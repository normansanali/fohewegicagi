Colleen Wolfe’s Husband<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Colleen Wolfe has been married to her husband, John Gonzalez, for over eleven years.</p><p>Gonzalez is a sportswriter best known for his coverage of the NBA. He is the host of the podcast The Ringer NBA Show: Heart Check. He hosts the podcast on Sports Illustrated every Wednesday.</p><p>The couple dated for several years before getting married in September 2011. They celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary on September 7, 2021.</p><p>Based on their social media posts, we can conclude that the couple has a healthy relationship. Several of John’s photos can be found on Colleen’s Instagram.</p><p>Similarly, John carries Colleen with him wherever he goes, if not in the flesh, then in a photograph.&nbsp;Gonzalez has a signature picture of Wolfe that he always carries with him and never forgets to display her whenever he takes a picture and posts it on Twitter.</p><p>Previously, John worked for the Philadelphia Inquirer as a sports columnist, TV host, and analyst for NBCSportsPhilly. He was also the host of the Comcast Sportsnet show The 700 Level.</p><p>He resigned from the Inquirer Sports Station to relocate to the West Coast.

As Wolfe is 37 years old and John is currently 45 many had assumed that the pair were parenting their children.</p><p>However, it does not appear that they have children, and to protect their privacy they have kept them out of the public eye.</p><p>They are currently focused on their careers and may have children in the near future.</p><p>However, the duo has a pet dog named Doug, whom they adore just as much as their children.</p><p>We will update you with the news concerning their offspring as soon as they make any announcement about it.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=john-gonzalezs-net-worth-how-rich-is-a-sportswriter></span>John Gonzalez’s Net Worth, How Rich Is A Sportswriter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>John Gonzalez is a sportswriter who has a net worth of $50,000 as of 2022.</p><p>His primary source of income as of now is Sports Illustrated, where he is a senior writer and the host of a podcast.
