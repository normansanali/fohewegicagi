Thought I’d always get picked last, or guys wouldn’t get me the ball. I felt isolated.”</p><p>As the son of an NBA agent and publicist, Turell grew up around the NBA, and the family knows what it takes to get there.</p><p>The goal was always to get a Division I scholarship – so he could be playing in the March Madness spotlight right now – but it didn’t work out after he de-committed from Army, turned down preferred walk-on spots in major conferences and went to Yeshiva.</p><p>Harold Katz, a scout for Yeshiva, was the former coach of Tamir Goodman, who was dubbed “Jewish Jordan” by Sports Illustrated. Goodman turned down a scholarship offer from Maryland in the 1990s because their schedule conflicted with Orthodox values.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Ryan Turell of Yeshiva shoots the ball during a game against Worcester Polytechnic Institute on March 6, 2020.<span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>“I’ve always said that the Jews as a people are not as gifted athletically as others,” Katz told The Times, “but the world is much more sensitive to differences in people than they were 20 years ago.”</p><p>One of Turell’s teammates said he is called “Jewboy” on the court. Former Knicks phenom Jeremy Lin, who was the first player of Chinese descent to reach the NBA, recently <a href=#>said he faces racial taunts on the court</a> in the developmental G-League.</p><p>At least two NBA teams are scouting Turell’s team, and one league executive told The Times that “Ryan is certainly on the radar.” Yeshiva has won 37 straight games, dating to last season, which was canceled mid-tournament.</p><p>“We’re serious. Jews can play basketball,” Turell said. “I made a decision to really be a part of something special, to be a Jewish hero and to create the dream — a basketball culture for Jews — and make this program, which had been seen as a joke, a high-major one.”</p><p>“I’m ready to make history.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnoq6ur3nTrqmepJxixLC602aZnmWZo3qurdGcn2alkZm7pr%2FSZpmurF2YvLa4w2aZnmWWnr%2B0wIyoqa2gn5m8uXnJnq6iq5hiu6OtjKmjmrGVp3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./priyanka-chopra-nick-jonas-family-getaway-dubai-daughter-malti.html><span>←</span><span>Priyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas, and Malti Enjoy Family Getaway in Dubai</span></a>
