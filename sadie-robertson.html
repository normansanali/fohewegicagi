Sadie Robertson was the first runner-up on&nbsp;<i>Dancing with the Stars</i>&nbsp;Season 19.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadie Robertson was born as <strong>Sadie Caroway Robertson Huff</strong> on <i>June 11, 1997</i>, in Monroe Lousiana. She is among the six children born to <strong>Korie Robertson</strong> and her husband, <strong>Willie Robertson</strong>. She has five siblings: <strong>John Luke Robertson, </strong><a href=#><strong>Rebecca Loflin</strong></a><strong>, Willie Robertson Jr.,</strong> <a href=#><strong>Bella Robertson</strong></a><strong>, and Rowdy Robertson</strong>. Nothing much about her education and academic qualification is shared with the public.&nbsp;</p><h2>Sadie Robertson, A Newly Married Bride</h2><p>Sadie is living a happy married life along with her husband. She is married to her longtime boyfriend, <strong>Christian Huff</strong>. Sadie tied her wedding knot on <i>November 25, 2019,</i> at her family's farm in Louisiana.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/7/13/duck-dynasty-wedding%20(1)-1594630869797.jpg><p>Sadie was in a romantic relationship with Huff for some last few years. Nothing much about their first meeting is shared with the public. The love bond seems to be increasing day by day.&nbsp;</p><h2>Lavish and Lucrative Wedding</h2><p>Over 600 guests attended the wedding, including&nbsp;<i>Fuller House</i>&nbsp;star&nbsp;<strong>Candace Cameron Bure</strong>&nbsp;who wished Sadie and Christian well on Instagram. Sadie opted for a classic strapless gown for the <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>ceremony </strong></a>and changed into a lacy, "fairytale" dress for the reception.&nbsp;</p><p>Bridesmaid dresses are midnight blue. Christian is in all black and white, and then all the groomsmen are black, so it looks very sharp. Sadie's paternal grandparents,&nbsp;<strong>Phil</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Kay Robertson</strong>, also attended the ceremony.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/7/13/Sadie-Robertson-and-Christian-Huff-wedding%20(1)-1594630921652.jpg><p>A tennis court on the property was transformed for the ceremony location — a "unique and fun" decision that represented the couple's love of the sport. "Christian and I both love night, we love the stars and the moon, so I think all of it's going to be so magical," she said.</p><p>Pastor Louie Giglio officiated weddings for the couple. After the ceremony, guests ate and danced the night away under a large tent. The two had planned their honeymoon in Cabo San Lucas. On <i>June 9, 2019</i>, Robertson became engaged to Christian Huff.&nbsp;</p><h2>Net Worth and Earnings</h2><p>Sadie is much early in her professional career. She possesses an enormous talent and will be adding much more in the upcoming days to come.
