<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Kobe Bryant: 8 amazing quotes to live by from the NBA legend</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The tragic death of NBA legend <a href=# rel=noopener>Kobe Bryant</a> at the age of 41 has sent shockwaves throughout the world. Bryant and eight other passengers including his 13-year-old daughter Gigi were killed in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California.</p><p>Bryant will undoubtedly go down as one of the best to ever play the game of basketball. However, not only was the 15-time All-NBA performer excellent on the basketball court, but he was also one of the most passionate players in all of sports as well as being <a href=#>the ultimate competitor</a>.</p><p>These traits showed in Bryant's demeanor and the way he spoke. He influenced an entire generation and his impact will absolutely live on far in the future.</p><p><strong>“It’s the one thing you can control. You are responsible for how people remember you—or don’t. So don’t take it lightly.”</strong></p><p>Speaking on his legacy and reputation, Bryant more than cemented himself as a legend in the game of basketball. Winning five championships for the <a href=# rel=noopener>Los Angeles Lakers</a>, you better bet that he will be remembered for years to come.</p><p><strong>“I can't relate to lazy people. We don't speak the same language. I don't understand you. I don't want to understand you.”</strong></p><p>Not only was Bryant one of the most talented players of his generation and perhaps all time, but the Black Mamba's work ethic was also the stuff of legends. Bryant spent countless hours working and improving his game throughout his 20 seasons in the league.</p><p><strong>“I've played with IVs before, during and after games. I've played with a broken hand, a sprained ankle, a torn shoulder, a fractured tooth, a severed lip, and a knee the size of a softball. I don't miss 15 games because of a toe injury that everybody knows wasn't that serious in the first place.”</strong></p><p>Kobe Bryant played in at least 65 games in 17 of his 20 seasons. His two free throws on a torn Achilles often comes to mind for most people, but Bryant was one of the toughest players of his era and overcame countless setbacks.</p><p><strong>“Everything negative – pressure, challenges – is all an opportunity for me to rise.”</strong></p><p>Bryant had his fair share of criticism throughout his career. Can he win without Shaq? Can he get his teammates involved? Kobe took all of the pressure and turned it into one of the best careers in NBA history.</p><p><strong>“I had to organize things. So I created the ‘Black Mamba’. So Kobe has to deal with these issues, all the personal challenges. The Black Mamba steps on the court and does what he does. I’m destroying everybody that steps on the court.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Bryant's alter ego of sorts, The Black Mamba is one of the greatest nicknames in the history of sports.</p><p><strong>“These young guys are playing checkers. I'm out there playing chess.”</strong></p><p>Towards the end of his career, Kobe Bryant used his knowledge of the game to beat younger and more athletic players:</p><p><strong>“I've shot too much from the time I was 8 years old. But ‘too much' is a matter of perspective. Some people thought Mozart had too many notes in his compositions. Let me put it this way: I entertain people who say I shoot too much. I find it very interesting. Going back to Mozart, he responded to critics by saying there were neither too many notes or too few. There were as many as necessary.”</strong></p><p>Kobe responding to critics of his high-volume style of play makes for one of my favorite quotes of all time:</p><p><strong>“I would go 0-for-30 [from the floor] before I would go 0-for-9. [An] 0-for-9 means you beat yourself, you psyched yourself out of the game. … The only reason is because you've just now lost confidence in yourself.”</strong></p><p>Among the same lines, Kobe Bryant was completely unapologetic about his style of play and he never pulled his punches.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnKrBpLTPqKCnrKNjsLC5jqSmm51dl7%2B6rc2tZHFlkaKuu7XNoGSqrZ%2BpsrR506hkpaGmmnqjxQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kissing-booth-3-is-actor-taylor-zakhar-perez-gay-in-reality.html><span>←</span><span>Kissing Booth 3: Is Actor Taylor Zakhar Perez Gay In Reality?</span></a>
