old.&nbsp;The teenage actor would later go on to hold a black belt in Shotokan Karate and Tang Soo competed as a Muay Thai boxer.&nbsp;He mastered the American Kenpo, which he learned under the

in divorce proceedings.</span></p><p><span>Following his divorce from Sameerah, Noah Met became involved with Elizabeth Medlin, although the duo fell out in 2018 after the former child actor accused his new love of molestation, claiming she kicked his dog on purpose.&nbsp;Noah also made headlines in 2017 when he launched a crowdfunding campaign to help him fund his expensive spinal fusion

bills.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Where is he now?</span></strong></h2><p><span>The last Noah Hathaway to appear on screen was in 2016, reprising his role as Neverending Story in favor of a Spotify

bills.</span></p><p class=postsid
