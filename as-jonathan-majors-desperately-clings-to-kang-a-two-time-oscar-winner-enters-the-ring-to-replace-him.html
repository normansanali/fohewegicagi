Going in the opposite direction, though, one fancast that’s gaining some popularity online pitches a literal living legend of the acting industry as Majors’ replacement. Could we ever see Denzel Washington portray an older Kang?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Recast as an Older Kang… Denzel Washington</a><br>by <a href=#>u/n_droo_yu_el</a> in <a href=#>marvelstudios</a></figure><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>No one would turn down the chance to have someone of Washington’s caliber in the MCU, so of course this Reddit thread is full of praise for the Hollywood heavyweight who could definitely embrace the challenge of playing so many variants of the same character.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by <a href=#>u/aboynamedbluetoo</a> from discussion <a href=#>Recast as an Older Kang… Denzel Washington</a><br>in <a href=#>marvelstudios</a></figure><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>Ironically, however, the only dissenting replies came from those thinking Denzel’s son, John David Washington, would be a better choice.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by <a href=#>u/Sandros76</a> from discussion <a href=#>Recast as an Older Kang… Denzel Washington</a><br>in <a href=#>marvelstudios</a></figure><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>Although, given the whole variant thing, even that wouldn’t preclude Washington Snr. from playing Kang too.
