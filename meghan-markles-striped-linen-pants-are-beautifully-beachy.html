So long, mom jeans and sparkly, Euphoria-inspired crop tops. Hello, flowing white caftans, straw hats, and a slightly over-poured, but perfectly chilled glass of Chardonnay. Coastal grandmother chic has arrived, and she’s not leaving until that wine tumbler is bone dry.</p><p>The latest celeb to get in on the beach-y, breezy look is a surprising one, but boy, are we glad to see it. Miss Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex herself, is here to give Diane Keaton a run for her money. People reported that on June 4, Markle and her husband, Prince Harry, celebrated their daughter’s first birthday with a backyard picnic at their Frogmore Cottage home. A recent Instagram shows birthday girl Lillibet looking equally coastal grandmother chic (yes, babies can be coastal grandmothers, too!), cheesin’ in a ruffley blue smock and a white flower headband. But swipe and you’ll find Markle wearing airy, striped linen trousers, which are practically Newport or Nantucket in pants form.</p><p>I mean, one look at these effortless trousers and I can basically hear Seal & Crofts’ “Summer Breeze” tinkling in the background. They make me want walk on the beach barefoot, wrapped in a Turkish towel while my hypothetical Golden Retriever, Henley or Fitz, splashes in the waves. They make me want to cut a bouquet of hydrangeas from my imaginary, overflowing garden, which I will promptly put in a vase before coyly cuddling up in one of those chunky knit blankets to drink my coffee and complete a crossword puzzle to keep “the mind sharp.”</p><p>It’s not just their preppy, casual vibe—it’s their feel. Not all of us have access to the ocean, and when it gets really hot out, we need something that’ll keep things breezy and light. Linen is one of those fabrics that transcends the coast, keeping you cool and comfortable, no matter how high the temps sore. Markle’s choice isn’t only trendy, but practical, too.</p><p><span class="inline pr-6 text-seafoam-dark">Related Stories</span></p><p>Summer is technically still a few weeks out, so there’s still time. Pour yourself a glass of Chardonnay (or a Perrier—you do you), cue up some Something’s Gotta Give,&nbsp;and snag yourself some breezy striped linen pants, too.</p><h2 class="text-h2 wg-inline-shopable__title mb-[20px]">10 striped linen pants that you won’t take off all summer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/J-Crw-Seaside-Pants.jpg><p>J.Crew, Seaside Pant — $88.00</p><p><strong>Originally $98, now $88</strong></p><p>J.Crew’s Seaside Pants are legendary for their supreme softness and all-over comfort.

Head on over to Anthropologie. Instead of light, nautical stripes, they’re dark and moody, printed with a black and gold pinstripe that can be dressed up or down. But the pockets, drawstring feature, and baggy silhouette means they’ll stay just as cool as the others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Faherty-pants-scaled.jpg><p>Faherty, Malibu Linen Pull-On Pant — $99.00</p><p><strong>Originally $139, now $99</strong></p><p>Faherty is a goldmine for all-things coastal chic. These linen pull-on pants fit the bill, swapping heavy materials for easy, breezy linen. The chunky tan stripes look amazing with just about anything, but if you want to get matchy-matchy, you can complete the set with <span>Malibu Linen Shirt</span> ($99).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Alex-Crane-Bo-Shorts.jpg><p>Alex Crane, Bo Shorts — $78.00</p><p>If you really wanna stay cool this summer, trade the trousers for a pair of striped linen shorts.

They’re slightly cropped and bit more flared than the others, giving them an even more casual “cool-for-the-summer vibe.” They’re also only $28, the cheapest on this list. We love the stripes, but there are also 19 other patterns and colors to choose from (or stock up on).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Billabong-Striped-Pants-.jpg><p>Billabong, Daybreak Wide Leg Pants — $60.00</p><p>Prepare yourself—you will never want to take Billabong’s breezy trousers off.
