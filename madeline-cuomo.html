Therefore, she is mostly famous because of being one of the members of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Cuomo family</a>.</p><p>However, since her family background is related to American politics, Cuomo has also been engaged in many political things since the starting point of her career.</p><p>Additionally, as a Matrimonial Lawyer, she mostly deals with the matrimonial relationships of people like marriage, divorce, and child custody.</p><p>She isn’t as popular as her other siblings.

Moreover, if we look at her career then, she is doing a fantastic job which is enough for her living.</p><p>Therefore, it’s not that she isn’t in politics at all.
