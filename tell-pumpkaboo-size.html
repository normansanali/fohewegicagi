There are a few different ways that you can do to check what kind of Pumpkaboo you’re looking at, both in the wild and in your Pokemon storage. You just need to know where to look. Here’s what you need to do.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.gosu-noob.com/static/img/1/2023/10/how-to-tell-pumpkaboo-size-pokemon-go-640x360.webp><h2>How to Tell What Size is Your Pumpkaboo?</h2><p>Before we explain how to tell what the size of your Pumpkaboo is in Pokemon GO, we have to mention that there are four different versions. The possible sizes are categorized as XS, Normal, XL and XXL. It really doesn’t matter which one you get, since it doesn’t affect much performance-wise. It’s just about the collection aspect; as in, whether or not you want to catch one of each size just for bragging rights. Well, the largest size does have the biggest Stamina and HP pool at a fairly minor cost to Attack and Defense, so it is the best option. Overall, though, whichever version you have, you’ll probably do just as fine. Anyways, let’s get into the meat of the matter.</p>';document.getElementById("serge_5f895c6208f81a315320ec57").style.display = "block"; }<p>So, the easiest way to tell what size a Pumpkaboo is in Pokemon GO is to compare its size to the catch circle to your Poke Ball. If the circle is significantly smaller than the ball, you’re looking at an XS Pumpkaboo (or Gourgeist, for that matter). On the other hand, if the circle is slightly smaller, then it’s a Normal. if the circle is about the same size as the ball, the Pumpkaboo or Gourgeist is an XL, and if the circle is noticeably bigger, then it’s an XXL. As far as the Pumpkaboos you already own go, you can search them by size. Type in Pumpkaboo and XS/XL/XXL. You can’t select for the Normal version. Also, sorting your Pokemon storage by number should sort them by size.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLvSrqWop5JjsLC5jqmmpJ2dpLtus85oq56knGK9trnPpJibp59iwKrGxGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heat-is-one-of-the-best-movies-ever-watch-it-on-netflix-right-now.html><span>←</span><span>Heat is one of the best movies ever.
