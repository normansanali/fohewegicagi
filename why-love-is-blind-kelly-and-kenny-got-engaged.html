The show received rave reviews at the start of its fifth season, and it still remains popular with fans.</p><p>However, with it being a few years since the first season aired, many fans might have forgotten former couple Kenny and Kelly. They made it all the way through to the final episode of doing their vows on the show, avoiding much of the <a href=#>drama their cast mates experienced</a>, but the pair later went their separate ways.

At the time that the show was airing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">therapists ranked the Love Is Blind couples</a> based on who was most likely to last, with Veronica Chin Hing saying that the couple really bonded over their core values and were good at communicating with one another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It appeared that this was what audiences at home seemed to really like about the pair as well, with many couples being able to relate to what they were going through and just generally enjoying their personalities.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/sal-from-love-is-blind-is-living-a-very-different-life-after-leaving-the-show.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Sal From Love Is Blind Is Living A Very Different Life After Leaving The Show</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>What does Love Is Blind season 2 cast member Sal Perez's love life and career look like today?</span><h2 id=kelly-and-kenny-only-got-engaged-to-stay-on-the-show>Kelly And Kenny Only Got Engaged To Stay On The Show</h2><p>The whole premise of Love Is Blind is that singles will each go into a pod and converse with someone else in one of the other pods and over a matter of days they might forge a connection. If there is a connection there, they will end up getting engaged and continue on with the rest of the show up until their wedding day, where they may or may not end up married.</p><p>Whilst many may have thought that Kelly and Kenny's love for one another was genuine, it appears that this was never the case. While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly and Kenny might have had an interest in one another</a> and got engaged, this engagement wasn't to actually get married but was just to ensure that they could stay on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They had apparently agreed that there was a connection there that they wanted to explore more and give a chance, but had agreed that when it came to walking down the aisle and saying "I do," that wouldn't be happening.</p><p>Despite this, they had also agreed that they would continue dating once the show came to an end.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/love-is-blind-kelly-kenny-1.jpg><p>Both Kelly and Kenny had seen being in the experiment as an opportunity to get to know each other better and felt that if they didn't get engaged and stayed in the experiment, this wouldn't happen. However, while Kelly was of the opinion that what they had agreed would go ahead, Kenny had other ideas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Kelly, when it came to their last day of filming with them at their wedding, Kenny came over to her and told her that it was over. He apparently told her that he was "emotionally unavailable" at that moment and that he wanted some time away from Kelly.</p><p>They apparently never talked for quite a few weeks after the experiment ended, with Kenny insisting that this decision was genuinely all to do with him and nothing to do with Kelly. He said he found the entire thing quite stressful, as did his friends and family, and that he needed to take a bit of time out to process everything and the complexities of life.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/A2FCC8B9-1051-4B23-800A-307B524BF582.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Love Is Blind Alum Giannina Gibelli Reacted After Receiving A Cryptic Message From Ex Damian Powers</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Love is Blind alums Giannina Gibelli and Damian Powers had a rocky relationship; it was further complicated when Powers sent Gibelli several messages.</span><p>However, one of the <a href=#>secrets of </a><a href=#>Love Is Blind</a> is that producers apparently encourage the engaged couples to break up when they're at the altar as opposed to breaking up at another stage of the show, so a potential word of encouragement from production may have persuaded them to stay on the show as opposed to leaving sooner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-kelly-and-kenny-after-love-is-blind>What Happened To Kelly And Kenny After Love Is Blind?</h2><p>After they finished filming Love Is Blind Kelly decided to send Kenny a letter as they hadn't spoken for quite a few weeks, and she wanted to let him know how she was feeling, that she enjoyed getting to know him and wanted to continue to get to know him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/love-is-blind-kelly-kenny.jpg><p>However, Kenny never replied to the letter and ended up ghosting Kelly.
