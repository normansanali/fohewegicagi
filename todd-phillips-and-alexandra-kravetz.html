Though the highly coveted <a href=#>Oscars</a>’ plus-one invite is sometimes reserved for<a href=#> stars’ family members</a> or best friends, a number of couples have made their<a href=#> red carpet</a> debuts at the Academy Awards. Even more so, the special night has become the perfect setting for A-list couples to profess their love for each other — whether in <a href=#>acceptance speeches</a> or with a sweet comment at a party after the fact. There are worse places to bring a date, huh?</p><p>The stars weren’t shy at the 2022 Oscars, with multiple couples hitting the red carpet ready to flaunt some PDA. <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Travis Barker</strong></a> — a pair known for getting handsy just about everywhere — got a little hot and heavy while making out for the cameras. Another duo unafraid to express their affection for each other is <a href=#><strong>Wilmer Valderrama</strong> </a>and his fiancee, <strong>Amanda Pacheco</strong>, who raised eyebrows when the Encanto voice actor couldn’t keep his hands to himself.</p><p>Other celebs whose romances shined throughout the night included <a href=#><strong>Kristen Stewart</strong></a> and <strong>Dylan Meyer</strong>, who celebrated the star’s best actress nomination for Spencer with a smooch on the red carpet. Cohost <a href=#><strong>Amy Schumer</strong></a> temporarily ditched her close friends — whom she brought with her to the star-studded event — to lock lips with husband <a href=#><strong>Chris Fischer</strong></a> before opening the show.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Niecy Nash</strong></a> and wife <strong>Jessica Betts</strong> also put their love on display prior to the show. The actress and the singer-songwriter, who married in August 2020, shared a kiss while walking the carpet. Additionally, Nash wore her heart on her sleeve (or rather, her purse), carrying a clutch emblazoned with the words, “Wifey for Lifey.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While the the Oscars don’t have a specific category for best onscreen kiss, Hollywood is still eager to show that they care just as much about their costars off camera as they do on. <a href=#><strong>Julie Delpy</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Ethan Hawke</strong></a>, who starred together in Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and Before Midnight, struck an affectionate pose in 2014 — a special treat for fans of their movie romance.</p><p>Scroll to see celebrities’ best PDA moments at the Oscars over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BYsq2xwaugrbFdpMCkrdGsZKmckWJ%2FcX2Ta2trZ6SksaV5z6GgpaSZpcBurc2dZJqkla2ur7DRmmSkqpGrsrXGjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./big-ed-90-day-fiance-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Big Ed 90 Day Fiance Net Worth Phone Number, House Address, Wiki</span></a>
