Since this is the most obvious example, it doesn’t necessarily apply here, but it just goes to show that Stranger Things wouldn’t have existed without Will battling the Mind Flayer. However, there are also minuscule moments that are infinitely important to the overarching Stranger Things storyline which are often overlooked in favor of the most impactful events.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>What are some small events that if they didn’t happen would change the show drastically?</a> from <a href=#>StrangerThings</a></figure><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=577 data-injectable=true>Reddit has compiled a few memorable and influential moments from Stranger Things that might not have been world-altering, but definitely made a significant ripple in continuity.

For example, a butterfly beating its wings could start a hurricane years from now. It all depends on wind trajectory, speed, strength, etc.</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true>Think about it, if you hadn’t visited that coffee shop on a Saturday in July, you never would have met your best friend. Maybe that analogy isn’t entirely accurate, but you get the point. If it still isn’t completely clear, check out Supermassive Games’ hit horror game Until Dawn — which implements the butterfly effect mechanic — and that will explain everything.</p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>There are countless examples of where “what ifs” make us reconsider our whole life, so Stranger Things remains very realistic in that department, which is a lot to ask for a Netflix series about monsters and superpowers. In the grand scheme of things, if these small incidents hadn’t happened, Stranger Things could have been a very different show — and that applies in real life as well.</p><p data-characters=66 data-current-count=66 data-injectable=false>All seasons of Stranger Things are currently streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9KtqZqml5q%2FbsDHoqWgq12brq%2B%2FjKeYpp1dqbWmedOipaKdo6l6rrvMnqWtq12ptaLAjJ6lnZ2UYsKxecearaKml2KubrnArKqirpVitq68wJyraA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steven-porter.html><span>←</span><span>Steven Porter</span></a>
