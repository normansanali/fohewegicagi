The Boss’ big return was also a huge heel turn, but some fans were even more shocked at another change Banks made. Because Sasha Banks’ trademark purple hair is now blue.
WWE didn’t waste any time making this change official either. Because they altered Sasha Banks’ profile on their website right away."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
