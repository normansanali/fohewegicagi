After playing <a href=#>Maddie and Diggie</a> on Liv and Maddie, the pair took their love from off the TV screen and into real life.</p><p>They first started dating in 2013, and throughout their time together, the couple often packed on the PDA via social media, formed a band —&nbsp;<a href=#>The Girl and the Dreamcatcher</a>&nbsp;— together and got engaged. However, the pair called it quits in 2016 before getting a chance to tie the knot.</p><p>After the&nbsp;<a href=#>Descendants</a> star and <a href=#>Wicked</a> actor split, the former lovebirds had a lot of drama surrounding the breakup. At one point,&nbsp;Dove <a href=#>claimed Ryan had treated her badly</a> during their relationship. Then, Ryan&nbsp;<a href=#>accused Dove of cheating on him</a>&nbsp;with her then-boyfriend,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Thomas Doherty</strong></a>.</p><p>While Dove has never publicly addressed Ryan’s claims head on, she did post about “toxic people” following his cheating allegations.&nbsp;“When a toxic person can no longer control you, they will try to control how others see you,” she shared at the time. “The misinformation will feel unfair, but stay above it, trusting that other people will eventually see the truth, just like you did.”</p><p>It’s safe to say, things got a little messy at times. However, in 2020, Ryan appeared to revisit their past.</p><p>“Within two weeks, my fiancée cheated on and left me, I almost died from food poisoning and <strong>Donald Trump</strong> was elected president. I truly didn’t think I would be able to make it through that part of my life,” he shared via Instagram Stories in January 2020, when recounting his proudest moment in life. “I’m proudest of the light that came from the darkness. And my ability to survive and turn the anger and sadness I had into positive life changes and a new way forward.”</p><p></p><p>In January 2021, when announcing his song “Politician,” Ryan also appeared to still harbor some not-so-nice feelings about his ex.</p><p>“I wrote this song about the power of lying in love,” the musician <a href=#>wrote on Instagram</a>&nbsp;at the time, explaining the song’s meaning. “As an adult I was madly in love with a woman who mobilized a cult of personality so freely and effectively that I get regular death threats to this day.”</p><p>So, what really went down between Dove and Ryan?&nbsp;<strong>Scroll through our gallery for a complete timeline.</strong></p><p>Love J-14?
