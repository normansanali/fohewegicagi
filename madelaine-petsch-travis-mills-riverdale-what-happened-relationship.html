At the time of their split, Madelaine didn't address the breakup and deleted several pictures of her and her ex.</p><p>However, Travis announced the demise of the relationship in a lengthy Instagram post where he had nothing but good things to say about the Riverdale star and their time together.</p><h2 id=they-weren-39-t-afraid-to-show-their-love-publicly>They Weren't Afraid To Show Their Love Publicly</h2><p>It's easy to forget that when it comes to love, celebrities are just like the rest of us. Most people will go to great lengths to find the love of their life. That includes putting themselves out there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Which can also include direct messaging their crush on social media. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter aren't dating sites but can be great mediums for connecting with people.</p><p>Madelaine and Travis were among numerous celebs who met on social media. Travis reached out to Madelaine on Facebook following the premiere of the CW hit show Riverdale, which he'd auditioned for. Although he lost the part to Cole Sprouse, this didn't stop him from messaging Madelaine to congratulate her.</p><p>That was the beginning of their love story. They were a fan favorite couple and weren't afraid to gush about each other on social media. The duo often shared cute couple pictures of them together. Travis even regularly appeared on Madelaine's YouTube channel, to the delight of their fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Marie Claire, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Petsch gave insight into her relationship with Mills</a>. She revealed, " I'm dating an actor named Travis Mills. I generally don't go public with relationships, but it was one of those things where, when you know you know. And I know with him."</p><h2 id=their-break-up-was-amicable>Their Break-Up Was Amicable</h2><p>Sometimes, it's just not meant to be. After three years together, the pair went their separate ways. At the time, Madelaine stayed mum about the entire situation. It was Travis who announced the split on his Instagram.</p><p>The musician and actor shared a lengthy post, complete with a cute picture of him and Madelaine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mills expressed his gratitude for his relationship with Petsch. Their breakup was amicable and if his post is anything to go by, there were no hard feelings.</p><p>"While it pains me our journey has come to a close, I mean it when I say I'm so incredibly grateful to have shared the last 3 years with someone as compassionate, smart & wonderful as Madelaine. The personal growth made possible by our time together I wouldn't trade for anything."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Are Best Friends With Their Exes</a></span></p><p>While their relationship may have seemed perfect to the public, the exes had their fair share of challenges.</p><p>In fact, Travis noted, "There's a ton of privilege being able to do what we do, but there's a mountain of challenges. That said we were in it together... I've learned so much about myself & life from that unconditional love and support."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Travis went on to say that he regretted nothing and wouldn't be deleting their images from his account. True to his word, their pictures remain posted on his Instagram.</p><p>"While I'm holding back tears, I'm excited to see what you do next. I'll always have your back. I regret nothing."</p><h2 id=the-split-was-hard-on-madelaine>The Split Was Hard On Madelaine</h2><p>The split may have been amicable, but that doesn't mean it made it hurt any less. A year after their breakup, Petsch opened up about experiencing mental health struggles during the pandemic. The timeline coincided with her split from Travis.</p><p>In an interview, with Flaunt, the Riverdale star revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her mental health was at an all-time low</a>. Lucky for her, she had support—her best friend moved in with her during the difficult period in her life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Has Fame Affected Olivia Rodrigo's Mental Health?</a></span></p><p>"My mental health was at an all-time low. Every day was definitely a challenge, and therapy was absolutely key for me to keep sane."</p><p>She added, "My best friend moved in with me and that was a huge game changer for my mental health. I found ways to be creative while staying positive and reading books. I read this book called Vibrate Higher Daily, and it’s basically about how to radiate positivity. And I found more books to help me navigate."</p><p>In 2021, Madelaine is rumored to be dating Olympic fencer, Miles-Chamely Watson.
