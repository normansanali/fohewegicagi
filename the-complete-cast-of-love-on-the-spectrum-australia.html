As we eagerly await new installments of each iteration, we’re looking back on the complete cast of Love on the Spectrum Australia in seasons one and two.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true></figure><h2 id=h-jodi-rodgers data-injectable=false>Jodi Rodgers</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>Serving as the dating coach for both seasons of Love on the Spectrum Australia, Jodi Rodgers is an Australian sexologist and special education teacher. Throughout the course of the seasons, Rodgers appears frequently to help the show’s cast navigate the complex world of dating, often offering sage wisdom and putting anxious minds at ease.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Michael Theo</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true>Arguably the show’s breakout star, Michael Theo appeared in the very first episode of Love on the Spectrum Australia and has remained a fan favorite ever since. Theo, who has Asperger’s syndrome, became known for his sheer charisma, endearing sense of humor, and adorable relationship with Heather.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Kelvin Wong</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kelvin Wong (@227kelvinwong)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=689 data-injectable=true>While he might’ve only appeared in season one, Kelvin Wong’s presence was strong enough to garner the adoration of fans. Kelvin’s first-ever date with Jessica, in which the pair discuss manga and he teaches her how to use chopsticks, was the stuff of romcom magic, but equally engrossing is the news that Kelvin is currently working with Rodgers on a graphic novel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Chloe Hatch</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true>In perhaps one of the show’s cutest pairings, Chloe Hatch became quickly besotted with Mark in season one of Love on the Spectrum Australia. The fiery 22-year-old, who is partially deaf, introduced us to her best friend Brodie, her passion for cosplay designs, and unforgettable bout of pre-date jitters.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Maddi</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>Appearing for just one season, Maddi is remembered for her unashamed desire to be picky with who she dates (something this writer could learn from) and her affinity for tall men with green eyes. She went on a few dates throughout the season, though never found her perfect match.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>​​Olivia Sharpe</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@soda.pop.quiz href=#>@soda.pop.quiz</a><p>If you haven’t watched <a title=loveonthespectrum href=#>#loveonthespectrum</a> on Netflix are you even living? <a title=actuallyautistic href=#>#actuallyautistic</a> <a title=autisminwomen href=#>#autisminwomen</a> <a title=autismawareness href=#>#autismawareness</a> <a title=asd href=#>#asd</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Annalogue" href=#>♬ original sound – Annalogue</a></figure><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true>Olivia Sharpe’s one-season stint on Love on the Spectrum Australia was marked by her status as a hopeless romantic, her admission that she’s had a “bazillion” unrequited loves, and her offscreen passion for theater acting. Our hearts were collectively shattered when it was revealed that despite a promising date, Olivia did not find love with Jackson.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Mark Radburn</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>One of the few castmates to appear on both seasons, Mark Radburn sustained his arch with his effortless charm, his superfandom of Jurassic Park, and his platonic friendship with Ryan. And who could forget the bowling episode, when a very coquettish Mark gets tongue-tied while conversing with a girl?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Andrew</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true>Teddy bears, jigsaw puzzles, and a round of speed dating that could inspire any number of new Nancy Meyers movies are the hallmarks of season one star Andrew. The older castmate often lamented that he was running out of time to find love, so we hope he’s currently in a whirlwind romance (the Nancy Meyers kind).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ruth and Thomas</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>Introduced as an already established couple in season one, Ruth and Thomas captured hearts with their clear devotion to each other and shared love of Harry Potter. The couple challenged the idea that people on the spectrum couldn’t find meaningful relationships, and offered an end-goal vision for other castmates just beginning their dating journeys.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jimmy and Sharnae</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>Jimmy and Sharnae have appeared as a longterm couple in both seasons of Love on the Spectrum Australia. The pair first met in high school, and spent much of their stint on the show in clear adoration of each other, travelling to Las Vegas together and eventually tying the knot in season two.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ronan Soussa</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=559 data-injectable=true>One of multiple new castmates introduced in season two, Ronan Soussa quickly made waves with his adorable picnic and race car dates with Katie. By all accounts, the pair are still together, which reaffirms the possibility that perhaps true love is real.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Kassandra Nieass</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kassandra Nieass (@kassandra_personal_account)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=543 data-injectable=true>Season two newcomer Kassandra Nieass won audiences over with her fearlessness and passion for cosplay. In one episode, Kassandra came out as bisexual/pansexual, spawning a heartwarming moment in which her date also reveals he is LGTBQI+.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Teo Tish</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Teo Tissue (@teotissue)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>Moving from Texas to Australia at a young age, Teo Tish immediately established her presence with the cat-themed pirate flag that flew proudly out the front of her house. Teo was beloved for her passion for Tina Fey, and her premature worries about an as-yet nonexistent wedding day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jayden Evans</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=false>Making his debut in season two, Jayden Evans arguably holds the title for the most engaging dates of the entire series. His date with Charlotte might’ve ended in the friendzone (a canon event), but a second chance at love with Dan got us all in our feels. There was a clear chemistry between the pair, to the point where the show simply must bring them back for season three.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmmqiloKGytbGMnJisrF2ks264zq%2BcZqeeYsGpsYysp56bpKfCrnnArqqtqpGhtqJ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rebecca-romney-family-career-boyfriend-heritage-measurements.html><span>←</span><span>Rebecca Romney Family, Career, Boyfriend, History, Measurements</span></a>
