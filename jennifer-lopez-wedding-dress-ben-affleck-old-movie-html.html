But in the end it was the best possible wedding we could have imagined. One we dreamed of long ago and one made real (in the eyes of the state, Las Vegas, a pink convertible and one another) at very, very long last.”</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Diet Prada ™ (@diet_prada)</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5s5h7o1001d3b6v5tgaxldo@published data-word-count=108>Hold up! A dress from an old movie? It couldn’t be the lacey, off-the-shoulder, long-sleeved Zuhair Murad number that she exchanged vows in, so it appears that the first look, an Alexander McQueen gown, is the dress in question. “I’ve had this dress for so many years, and I’ve just been saving it, saving it, saving it, and now I’m wearing it on my wedding day,” she says in a video shared on Instagram. Which movie could have inspired such a decision? Was it a movie she starred in herself or one of her favorite films? Could the dress be connected to a movie in which Affleck co-starred?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5s5h7ub001e3b6v8zvmk866@published data-word-count=200>Naturally, Vulture reached out to J.Lo’s reps for comment. “We are not giving that out but thank you for asking,” her reps replied. No, thank you! J.Lo’s filmography offers few clues as well. There are at least seven films in which her character gets married, but the dresses she wore in those movies don’t match the Alexander McQueen gown. However, in 2004, J.Lo starred alongside Affleck in Jersey Girl, a comedy-drama about a single dad whose wife dies in childbirth, which came out the same year Bennifer called it quits the first time. Director Kevin Smith filmed a wedding scene for the movie — what he <a href=#>called</a> a “low-rent version of their dream day” on set at St. John’s Church in Paulsboro, New Jersey — but ultimately cut it after their real wedding prospects imploded. “I didn’t know [if it was right] to leave it in,” Smith <a href=#>told</a> Us Weekly at the time. “People might forget they’re watching a picture, like, ‘Wait, didn’t these two not get married?”’ He added, “At least, I got to go to one of their weddings. And I didn’t even have to buy a gift!” Could this dress be the dress from the old movie?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl5s5h7yh001g3b6vok89nvqt@published data-word-count=122>Smith teased a director’s cut of the 2004 movie early last year during an episode of his podcast, Fatman Beyond. “There’s a very long cut of Jersey Girl, which, recently, Paramount took over Miramax —&nbsp;they’ve got most of the library and stuff — and they were talking about, ‘Hey, we wanna put out Jersey Girl this year,’ and I was like, ‘Well, I have the extended cut, which I’ve shown at Vulgarthon.’ And if they allow me to, I wanna call that Jersey Girl: The Snyder Cut,” he <a href=#>said</a>. Vulture reached out to Smith for comment on the deleted scene and the dress. Here’s hoping Jersey Girl: The Snyder Cut contains the Bennifer wedding deleted scene to put this investigation to rest.</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl5pp0otv0000aoolqa3xo8w8@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Bennifer Has Tied the Knot</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckot4m5la0000dponcgkrjm8o@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Complete 20-Year Timeline of the Bennifer Saga</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckupsqmql0000hcogqoejb1zt@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Story of Bennifer, As Told by the Paparazzi Who Chase Them</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Did J.Lo Wear a Wedding Dress From an Old Bennifer Movie?</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpa2dgbHyrsc2noJ%2BdomK5sLzEs2SwnZSZtq%2BzjJ2pnqujYq%2BmuoyanZ%2BklZi4brvLnWSmp6aesm%2B006aj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bachelor-in-paradise-week-4-part-2-recap-season-8-episode-7-html.html><span>←</span><span>Bachelor in Paradise Recap: Villain Edit</span></a>
