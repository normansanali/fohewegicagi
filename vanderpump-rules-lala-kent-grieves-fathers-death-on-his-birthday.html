So, I think a lot of the stuff I see this season, I’m going to remember after I watch it. I was very foggy and just very emotional at the same time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGavmZ6ZsrO81KanZqqlobK0ecuao5plm5q7tXnGq6CerpWoeqet06Gcq6tdmbKiwMdmpqdlmJ7Abq7Iq6uhnJGufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-view-is-on-hiatus-when-the-show-will-return.html><span>←</span><span>The View Is on Hiatus: When the Show Will Return</span></a>
