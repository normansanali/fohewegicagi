The photo, taken on Easter, features the full family of five: Kim, Kanye, four-year-old North, two-year-old Saint, and three-month-old Chicago.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The reality star and KKW Beauty mogul has previously shared candids and selfies with little Chicago since welcoming her into the world on January 15, but this marks the infant's first appearance with both her parents and two older siblings.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I don’t think you really understand how hard it is to take a good family pic. This was all we got before all three kids started crying. I think I cried too," Kim captioned the portrait.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Shortly after sharing the image on Instagram, she revealed another behind-the-scenes secret on Twitter. Apparently she had "one hand holding the baby and the other hand grabbing the back of Saints shirt because he kept running away."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although the picture-taking process sounded a little chaotic, the end result is super sweet. Naturally, each member of the family is giving off a different pose, with Kim smizing, Kanye giving his classic frown, North throwing up a peace sign, Saint looking away (perhaps to flaunt his incredible tiny cornrows), and Chicago fast asleep.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kardashian also shared an outtake from the shoot earlier today, featuring a tender moment between her and her son.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This is the latest of heartfelt family moments Kim has recently shared on social media. Over the weekend, she posted a close-up of Saint giving his little sister a kiss on the nose:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And the week before that, she documented a family <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a19644093/kanye-west-kim-kardashian-zoo-pictures/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="trip to the zoo" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">trip to the zoo</a> with Kanye, North, and Saint:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also shared a candid moment of Kanye carrying North on his shoulders at the March for Our Lives rally, which the three of them <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a19587301/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-north-west-march-for-our-lives/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="attended together" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">attended together</a>:</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
