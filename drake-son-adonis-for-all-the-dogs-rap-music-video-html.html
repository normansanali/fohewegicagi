What, you want us to lie and say it doesn’t go hard? Let’s get him and <a href=#>Blue Ivy Carter</a> in the studio; see if we can make a “No Angel Pt. 2.” Adonis isn’t just talent, either. He’s credited as composer-lyricist “Adonis G.” Between his paintbrush (<a href=#>got it from his mama</a>) and his pen, Adonis is officially a double threat, prepared to usurp the title of GOAT from his false-king father.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clneon009000c3b82kku58pp1@published data-word-count=109><strong></strong>In a new video posted to social media ahead of <a href=#>his For All the Dogs release</a> on October 6, Drake asks his son, Adonis, to explain the drawing of a goat that became the upcoming album’s art. “And Daddy’s name is next to the goat.
