He attended Fordham Preparatory school, from which he matriculated in 1961. His interest in the money management business came at early age, as he bought his first stock when he was only 13 years old. Later, he enrolled on a scholarship at Fordham University, from where he emerged with a BA degree in 1965, graduating summa cum laude, after which he continued his education at Columbia Business School, where he earned his MBA degree. One of his professors at Columbia was Roger Murray, a well-known investing expert and the co-author of the Fifth Edition of “Security Analysis”, a book which is considered the basis of the value investing approach practiced by Gabelli throughout his career – the Graham-Dodd school of security analysis.</p><p>Soon after graduation, Gabelli was asked to work as a security analyst for Loeb, Rhoades & Co, responsible for coverage of auto parts conglomerates, farm equipment, and then media and broadcasting somewhat later.

He is also known as a former commentator on CNN, CNBC, and Bloomberg, as well as in the TV show “Walk Street Week With Louis Rukeyser”. Other than that, Gabelli has written a number of articles for various publications, and all of these interests have increased his net worth by a large margin.</p><p>Thanks to his accomplishments in the business industry, Gabelli was given the Lifetime Achievement Award by the New York Society of Security Analysts in 2014.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Mario Gabelli is married to Regina Pitaro.
