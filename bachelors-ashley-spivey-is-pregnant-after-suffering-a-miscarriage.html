We planned on transferring in May but I should have known, as with many parts of my life — if you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.”</p><p>The season 15 <a href=#>Bachelor</a> alum noted that it’s “still very early” — just six weeks and six days into her pregnancy — but she wanted to share the happy news.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Bachelor-Nations-Ashley-Spivey-Pregnant-After-Suffering-Miscarriage-2020-001.jpg><p>“I don’t want to have to stay silent about it because of taboos or a fear of jinxing it,” she wrote. “I’m scared and I’m nervous, but I’m also overjoyed. I’d be lying if I said that I’m not constantly thinking of CJ, but I have to think that he had a little part in this.”</p><p>The North Carolina native, <a href=#>who mourned the loss of son CJ in February</a> on what would have been his due date, revealed that her due date is December 9, but the doctors want her to deliver at 37 weeks.</p><p>“That means this lil seed baby will arrive sometime between the days that my Dad and CJ died,” she explained. “It’s like they knew I needed something to get me through November❤️.”</p><p>Spivey, who shares a dog named Jax with <a href=#>husband <strong>Steve Hunsberger</strong></a><strong>,</strong> shared the baby news two months after honoring her late son in a touching Instagram tribute.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Bachelor-Nations-Ashley-Spivey-Pregnant-After-Suffering-Miscarriage-2020-002.jpg><p>“Instead of bringing our boy home today, we brought him home early in December in this beautiful urn,” she captioned a photo showing a gold urn, a block reading “CJ” and a dog-patterned shirt. “Every morning I hold him close to me and wish that things were different. That my heart wasn’t broken into a million pieces. That I just would have made it to the hospital a little sooner.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former reality star suffered a miscarriage in November 2020 and documented the tragedy on social media. “I am very sad and very scared but more than anything, I am just completely heartbroken,” Spivey captioned an Instagram Story selfie at the hospital, noting the doctors couldn’t find the baby’s heartbeat. “I feel like a failure. … I’m so sad that I couldn’t protect him.”</p><p>Spivey previously <a href=#>suffered a pregnancy loss</a> in May 2019. “This was a very wanted pregnancy. Steve and I are both ready for a family,” she shared via Instagram at the time. “<a href=#>However, it was not meant to be this time</a>. While the doctor spotted the fetal pole cardiac activity at 6 weeks, on Monday (8 weeks) with my sis and Steve in the room we received some bad news — the embryo actually had shrunk and the doctor concluded that I was experiencing a miscarriage.”</p><p>The Bachelor Nation star married Hunsberger in May 2016 after competing on <strong><a href=#>Brad Womack</a>’</strong>s season of the ABC series in 2011.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGabmZOdsq270axkmquYobK6edKpoK%2BdqWK2tHnPq5ygppGjwW6txa2cq2WjqrOnsdGipaBlkWK6qr%2FCmqmroZGcsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alex-cowper-smith-wife-and-married-life.html><span>←</span><span>Alex Cowper-Smith | Wife And Married Life</span></a>
