The strut and/or air spring can fail on its own, but over time it will likely lead to a compressor failure. The compressor can fail independently or dependently.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-does-airmatic-suspension-last></span>How long does Airmatic suspension last?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Now, to your question about <b>AIRmatic</b>, it looks like the front air springs <b>last</b> anywhere between 10 and 15 years with typical American driving before needing replacement. The rears <b>last</b> longer, likely because they’re not supporting the weight of the engine nor having to deal with turns and such.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-know-if-my-mercedes-has-airmatic-suspension></span>How do I know if my Mercedes has Airmatic suspension?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>If</b> you <b>have airmatic</b> there will be a button by the gearshift to raise or lower the car. <b>If</b> you see normal springs, you don’t <b>have airmatic</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-know-if-i-have-airmatic-suspension></span>How do I know if I have Airmatic suspension?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>If</b> you <b>had</b> the full <b>airmatic suspension</b>, you would <b>have</b> a button with an “up” arrow on it for adjusting ride height. That would be on the right side of the console controls. Opposite that button on the left side would be another button labeled “Sport” and “Conf”. One push gives you a firm or sport <b>suspension</b> setting.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-often-do-you-replace-air-suspension></span>How often do you replace air suspension?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>One company estimates <b>you</b>‘ll need to <b>replace</b> each <b>air suspension</b> bag between 50,000 and 70,000 miles, while another estimates <b>replacement</b> every 10 years. In all cases, <b>suspension air</b> bags are in use at all times if <b>you</b>‘re driving and even <b>when you</b>‘re not.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-troubleshoot-air-suspension></span>How do you troubleshoot air suspension?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>How to <b>Troubleshoot Air Suspension</b></b><li class=TrT0Xe><b>Air</b> Leaks. Fill the water bottle with water and then put a few drops of soap in the bottle.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Pressure Switch. Check the pressure switch in the <b>air</b> system.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Testing the Compressor. Test the compressor for power if the pressure switch is working but the tank is not filling up with <b>air</b>.</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happens-if-air-suspension-fails></span>What happens if air suspension fails?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Too much moisture in the <b>air suspension</b> system<p><b>If</b> your <b>air</b> dryer assembly <b>fails</b>, the resulting moisture buildup will cause your system to rust and corrode. This issue can also affect the compressor, the leveling capabilities, and overall performance of your <b>air suspension</b>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-disadvantages-of-air-suspension></span>What are the disadvantages of air suspension?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Some of the <b>drawbacks of air suspension</b> systems are because of some of the mechanical issues they can be vulnerable to. Several of the common issues with <b>air suspension</b> systems that can require repair include: Rust or moisture damage from the inside that can lead to the <b>air</b> struts or bags to malfunction.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-drive-fast-with-air-suspension></span>Can you drive fast with air suspension?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Cody Miles is no stranger to the question ‘<b>can you</b> go <b>fast</b> on <b>air suspension</b>? ‘ and he’s proved the answer to be a resounding ‘YES! ‘. Gears and Gasoline caught up with him to find out what puts <b>Air</b> Lift Performance ahead of the field.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-most-common-problem-with-air-shocks></span>What is the most common problem with air shocks?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>One of the <b>most common air suspension problems</b> is a leaking <b>air</b> spring. With time, the rubber components of these parts will deteriorate, creating holes and tears and causing <b>air</b> leaks.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-drive-with-broken-air-suspension></span>Can you drive with broken air suspension?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>No. It is not recommended. A <b>damaged</b> or collapsed spring <b>can</b> cause sagging and noise and affect alignment angles. While <b>you can</b> still <b>drive</b>, the ride will be rough and the car will be difficult to control in an emergency.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-causes-air-suspension-to-break></span>What causes air suspension to break?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Air</b> Springs<p>The rubber seals inside the springs can wear out over time or the rubber <b>air</b> bags can <b>crack</b>, leaking <b>air</b> out of the system and <b>causing</b> the <b>suspension</b> to malfunction. You’ll notice a less-than-comfortable <b>ride</b>, or your vehicle may even be visually crooked.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-suspension-expensive-to-fix></span>Is suspension expensive to fix?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>You might be wondering how <b>much</b> a <b>repair</b> of the <b>suspension</b> is going to set you back. You need to look at the <b>cost to repair</b> or <b>replace</b> the <b>suspension</b>, plus the labor <b>cost</b> that will be associated with taking your car to an auto mechanic. The average <b>cost</b> of a <b>suspension repair</b> is between $1,000-$5,000.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-does-it-take-to-replace-suspension></span>How long does it take to replace suspension?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Suspension</b>. As we discussed in the original piece, <b>suspension repair</b> can vary drastically in time as much as it can in cost, because of how complex a system it is. <b>Replacing</b> a single set of <b>shocks</b>, for example <b>takes</b> between 2-3 hours, as <b>does</b> either side’s control arms.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-i-replace-struts-myself></span>Can I replace struts myself?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Strut Replacement</b><p><b>Replacing struts</b> used to be a dangerous job for a DIYer. But these days you <b>can</b> buy a complete <b>strut</b> assembly that eliminates the <b>strut</b>/spring/mount disassembly process. These assemblies allow you to <b>replace</b> both of your front <b>struts yourself</b> in less than two hours.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-takes-the-longest-to-fix-on-a-car></span>What takes the longest to fix on a car?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Most Challenging <b>Car</b> Repairs</b><li class=TrT0Xe>Replacing an Engine.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Clutch.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Spark Plugs.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Transmission. Transmission repairs are known to be expensive, so mechanics may find that some customers are reluctant to address these problems until they are at a crisis stage.</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-know-if-your-suspension-is-damaged></span>How do you know if your suspension is damaged?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Feeling every bump<p><b>An</b> easy <b>check</b> is <b>the</b> bounce test. Simply push <b>your</b> entire weight down on <b>your</b> car’s bonnet. Release and count <b>the</b> number of times <b>the</b> car bounces. <b>If</b> it bounces more than three times, then there is <b>a</b> problem with <b>your</b> shock absorbers or struts.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-noise-does-bad-suspension-make></span>What noise does bad suspension make?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>There are four <b>sounds</b> in particular that you should look out for: creaking, grunting, rattling, and knocking. See your auto collision center if you hear any of these <b>noises</b>, and keep reading for more on the four <b>sounds</b> of <b>suspension problems</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-symptoms-of-a-bad-control-arm></span>What are the symptoms of a bad control arm?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Another <b>symptom</b> commonly associated with <b>bad</b> or failing <b>control arm</b> components is steering wandering. Excessively worn ball joints, bushings, or a combination of these can <b>cause</b> the vehicle’s steering alignment to shift, which may <b>cause</b> the steering to pull to the left or right when traveling down the road.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-bad-shocks-cause-steering-problems></span>Can bad shocks cause steering problems?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>While <b>shocks</b> and <b>struts</b> wear out gradually, your vehicle may give you some signs that there is something wrong with its ride control components. <b>Worn shocks</b> and <b>struts can</b> have a detrimental effect on <b>steering</b>, stopping and the stability of your vehicle.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46hprBlpKR6s7HSnqtmmZmnuqLAyJxkpp2imLKlsdJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-read-the-fnaf-books-in-order.html><span>←</span><span>How to read the FNAF books in order</span></a>
