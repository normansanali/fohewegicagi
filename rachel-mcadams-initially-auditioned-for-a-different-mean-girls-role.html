The piece sought to clear up rumors and expose some secrets about the famous film, and Waters certainly delivered. He shared that Rachel McAdams was hoping to land the role of Cady Heron, the movie's sweet-natured leading lady. Waters, however, didn't think the actress would be able to pull it off.&nbsp;</p><p>"I told her, 'I think you're a movie star, but you're way too old for this character. You just aren't going to be able to play the ingenue,'" Waters said. McAdams was 24 years old at the time, while Cady was supposed to be 16, according to <a href=#>Insider</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Funnily enough, Waters also told <a href=#>Vulture</a> that Lindsay Lohan, who landed the role of Cady, was originally hoping to play McAdam's eventual role of Regina George. But the pieces fell into place for the director when he saw Lohan as Cady acting alongside McAdams as Regina, Cady's bully. "When Lindsay was acting with Rachel, she got very shy, because Rachel was older and a very accomplished actress," Waters shared. "Lindsay got kind of nervous around her, and I thought that, more than anything, was going to be the deciding factor, the fact that she affected Lindsay in that way."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcXFoZYR2e9GamqGdnGK6pK3DmqSsZZmjtrW1wKWjsmWRqrGqwMiopZ6cXZu8s3nAZpuinpaav6a602aknpmeYrSqvsusZKunnJp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-dachsbuns-well-baked-body-ability-explained.html><span>←</span><span>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet: Dachsbun's Well-Baked Body Ability Explained</span></a>
