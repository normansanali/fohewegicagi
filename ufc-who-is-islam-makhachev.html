How is he related to Khabib Nurmagomedov?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Islam Makhachev</strong> is a fast-rising UFC lightweight who is currently ranked number 9 in the world’s biggest MMA promotion. Hailing from the Republic of Dagestan, Makhachev took to the sport like a duck to water. With a record of 19 wins and just one loss, ‘The Dagestani’ has been soaring in the UFC.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Islam Makhachev</a> is currently on a 7-fight win streak, with his last loss, which happens to be his only loss, coming way back in 2015, against <strong>Adriano Martins</strong> at UFC 192. There has been no looking back for the Russian from there, as he has made his way up the lightweight ladder. In a matter of hours, he has an important assignment coming up against number 14 ranked Thiago Moises of Brazil at the UFC Fight Night headlined by the pair.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How is Islam Makhachev related to Khabib Nurmagomedov?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Islam-Makhachev-and-Khabib-1-1024x577.jpeg><p>Many might wonder if Islam Makhachev is related to the great <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a></strong>. The pair have been spotted together very often, posting training photos and videos, and always accompanying each other during fight weeks. In fact, both Khabib and Makhachev hail from the Republic of Dagestan. But, are they related? No, they aren’t.</p><p>Khabib and Makhachev have known each other right from childhood since both lived close to each other in Makhachkala. They often attended several Sambo competitions together. The friendship developed way back during their childhood has been strong even until today. They train together at their coach <strong>Javier Mendez’s</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Kick Boxing Academy</a>. Many believe Makhachev would be the man to carry on Khabib’s legacy.</p><p>Makhachev is highly valued by Khabib. In fact, ‘The Eagle’ has now become the coach of Makhachev following his retirement from MMA last year. Coach Khabib accompanied Makhachev in his last fight against Drew Dober at UFC 259. He will once again be by his corner as a coach, when Makhachev takes on Thiago Moises.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Also Read: <a href=#>Watch video: Conor McGregor breaks his ankle against Dustin Poirier at UFC 264</a></p><p>Also Read: <a href=#>UFC 264 (main event): Dustin Poirier beats Conor McGregor as ‘The Irishman’ breaks his leg; doctor stoppage victory</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK571J%2BaZq%2BYpHqqv4yiqqWZnWK6orfHmpqhnaZk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-alana-springsteen.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Alana Springsteen: Musics Next Big Star?</span></a>
