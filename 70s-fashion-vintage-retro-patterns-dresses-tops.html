Going retro is always a fabulous option. Vintage styles are some of the most fashionable out there. There are just two challenges: First is finding styles that exemplify popular trends from that time period, and second is find pieces that don’t look like they came out of a costume store."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Vintage styles are some of the most fashionable out there. There are just two challenges: First is finding styles that exemplify popular trends from that time period, and second is find pieces that don’t look like they came out of a costume store.</p><p>Right now, we are heavily feeling the ‘70s. The bold colors and patterns, and peasant and prairie blouses and dresses, the crochet, the patchwork, the paisley, the plaids — we’re obsessed. The evolution of the ‘60s hippie style played a huge role throughout the decade too. Want to see some ‘70s-inspired, vintage-style pieces we’re loving at the moment? We’ve picked out 21 tops and dresses for you!</p><h2>21 Patterned Dresses and Tops With Major ’70s Vibes</h2><h4>Peasant Dresses and Tops</h4><p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Our Absolute Favorite:&nbsp;</strong>With an airy feel, accent sleeves and a bold pattern that looks like embroidered, this&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Urban CoCo dress</a> is the best way to go for a modern peasant look!</p><p><strong>2. We Also Love: </strong>This <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Daniel Rainn Kaya Peasant Blouse</a>&nbsp;from Anthropologie has a breezy fit and such a cute tassel tie at the neckline!</p><p><strong>3. We Can’t Forget:&nbsp;</strong>This&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">R.Vivimos dress</a> truly looks like it stepped straight out of the ’70s!</p><h4>Floral Dresses and Tops</h4><p><strong>4. Our Absolute Favorite:&nbsp;</strong>The floral embroidery and fluttery sleeves on this&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Umgee Boho Bliss! dress</a> are perfection!</p><p><strong>5. We Also Love:&nbsp;</strong>This off-the-shoulder&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">DUTUT blouse</a> is another way to rock floral embroidery in a timeless way!</p><p><strong>6. We Can’t Forget:&nbsp;</strong>This&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">WNEEDU T-shirt dress</a> makes getting dressed simple, but it guarantees you’ll make a statement!</p><h4>Patchwork Dresses and Tops</h4><p><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Our Absolute Favorite:&nbsp;</strong>We can’t believe how affordable this absolutely adorable&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Room Service slip dress</a> is at Anthropologie!</p><p><strong>8. We Also Love:&nbsp;</strong>This&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">FARYSAYS top</a> combines multiple ’70s styles to create a patchwork dream of a blouse!</p><p><strong>9. We Can’t Forget:&nbsp;</strong>This&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bsubseach piece</a> is technically a cover-up, but we would totally wear it as a dress too when we’re not at the beach!</p><h4>Paisley Dresses and Tops</h4><p><strong>10. Our Absolute Favorite:&nbsp;</strong>Take the patchwork trend, make it paisley and go for a modern mini dress silhouette, and you have this fantastic&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">WDIRARA dress</a>!</p><p><strong>11. We Also Love:&nbsp;</strong>This navy paisley&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Madewell blouse</a> adds ruffle details at the shoulders and cuffs, solidifying it as a top you’ll never want to take off!</p><p><strong>12.&nbsp;</strong><strong>We Can’t Forget:&nbsp;</strong>This&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">SHOPESSA dress</a> has vacation vibes and deserves to be paired with a cute sun hat!</p><h4>Prairie Dresses</h4><p><strong>13. Our Absolute Favorite:&nbsp;</strong>Finding a legit prairie-style dress that isn’t a costume can actually be a little difficult, but once you hit it right, like with this&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">R.YIposha dress</a>, you have a piece you’ll never want to let go!</p><p><strong>14. We Also Love:&nbsp;</strong>We know the included bonnet can make this&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ROLECOS dress</a> seem pure costume, but if you imagine the dress by itself, so many cute outfit possibilities pop up!</p><p><strong>15. We Can’t Forget:&nbsp;</strong>This&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">KANCY KOLE dress</a> is such a chic way to create your own 2021 prairie look!</p><h4>Plaid Dresses and Tops</h4><p><strong>16. Our Absolute Favorite: </strong>Plaid is still very commonly worn today, but this yellow <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">SweatyRocks shirt</a> makes sure your colors are full ’70s!</p><p><strong>17. We Also Love:&nbsp;</strong>If you love plaid but prefer no buttons, this&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">FARYSAYS blouse</a> is the way to go, especially in orange!</p><p><strong>18. We Can’t Forget:&nbsp;</strong>The colors of this&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Eva Franco halter top</a> from Anthropologie make&nbsp;Us want to head straight to a ’70s party!</p><h4>Crochet Dresses and Tops</h4><p><strong>19. Our Absolute Favorite:&nbsp;</strong>We love crochet because it’s a pattern in itself. This funky&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bsubseach cover-up</a>, however, gives you a little extra with its rainbow floral design. Wear over a mini dress for daily life!</p><p><strong>20. We Also Love: </strong>This crochet&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Aphratti tank </a>is such a cute way to upgrade your summer wardrobe!</p><p><strong>21.
