On the day of the murder-suicide, Lester Jones entered the residence and shot and killed Traci-Marie before killing himself, police added.</p><p>Since the tragic incident, the community has come together to support the family of&nbsp;Traci-Marie Jones in the form of a GoFundMe page, which was started to support the "loving mother, daughter, sister, dear friend, mentor, teacher, stylist, and colleague gone way too soon," according to the fundraiser page.</p><p>"Traci touched the lives of so many and was known to light up the room with her laugh and her smile. To know Traci, was to love Traci," wrote Melissa Guner, a friend of Jones.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Guner, the family had not asked for money, but when they saw how much people wanted to contribute, they gave the fundraiser their blessing.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the fundraiser was started, the goal of $10,000 has been more than doubled, with the GoFundMe page collecting more than $20,000 as of Tuesday, Feb. 7.&nbsp;</p><p>"No one was prepared for her to be taken from us, and we are all still in shock and grieving,"&nbsp;Guner wrote on the GoFundMe page.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Those wishing to donate can do so by clicking here.&nbsp;</a></p><p class=e-click-here-follow-btn><a class=e-email-signup js-follow-button href=#>Click here</a> to follow Daily Voice Newtown and receive free news updates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmickZ65usLOopqeZpOkunCvzqelnpuknrC2wI6nnLCsn6y7cLrEsKporJ%2BqsKmxw2ajoq6VqHqwsoyspmalkaPGbrnOrZ%2Beql2Ztqa%2FjKKlZpqVqbWmuIymrKuclad6tMHInKCdnV2ptbDB0pqlnatdp66qv8SdZJ%2BnomKzornIpbBocGVrfnKEjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-spongebob-squarepants-will-rock-super-bowl-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Why SpongeBob SquarePants will rock Super Bowl 2024</span></a>
