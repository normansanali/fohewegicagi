The&nbsp;Blue Lady remained relatively unharmed, but something happened in the fall of 1969.
One account claims that Morrison crashed his car into a light pole, promptly went to a favorite local bar to spend the rest of the night, and returned to find The Blue Lady missing.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What is the best time of year to visit Roatan?</h2><time>Jul 20, 2024</time>
