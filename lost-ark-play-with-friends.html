Finding companions in-game is rather straightforward — with more than 1 million players, there's always someone tackling the same quest as you. If you're looking to play with a few friends, however, Lost Ark makes things even easier.</p><p>Here's everything you need to know about inviting friends to your Lost Ark party.</p><h2>Play Lost Ark with friends</h2><p>Like all online games, Lost Ark gives you an easy-to-access Friends menu. This is where you'll find recent players, friend requests, and invite friends to join your group. Here's a closer look at how the Friends menu works:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To access the Friends menu, simply press U on your keyboard. You can also find the Community tab on the bottom of your screen and open the Friends submenu.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you've opened the Friends menu, you'll find multiple tabs that offer information about current friends online, recent players, or incoming friend requests.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To invite an online friend to your game, simply click on their name and select the Invite button.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Keep in mind that you'll need to be on the same server as your friend to play together, so be sure to coordinate before jumping into the game.</p><h2>How to add friends in Lost Ark</h2><p>Lost Ark gives you a few ways to add players to your friends list. Here's how it works:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> If a player is nearby, simply hold down the Ctrl key and right-click on them. This will open up a menu that contains options to add them as a friend or invite them to your group.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If a player isn't nearby, you'll need to know their in-game name. With that info in hand, head back to the Friends menu and send a friend request using their info.</p><p>That's all there is to it! As long as you're on the same server as your friend and you know their in-game name, you'll be able to tackle every Lost Ark challenge as a team. Of course, you can always team up with random adventurers if none of your friends are online — which makes it easy to complete some of the game's most difficult content without needing to coordinate with a group.</p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVfnK6utc2gZqWno6l6or7KZqelmalixKrAx2adq6GVo7G0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./going-be-sweet-girl-scouts-are-going-digital-online-cookie-sales.html><span>←</span><span>Girl Scouts Are Going Digital with Online Cookie Sales</span></a>
