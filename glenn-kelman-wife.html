Source: Netflix Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman is one of the real estate tycoons on Netflix's hottest real-estate show Buy My House. The premise of the new series is a simple, Shark Tank-esque setup. Real estate owners looking to sell their prime properties pitch a sale to Glenn and three other moguls (Corcoran Group CEO Pamela Liebman, NFL linebacker Brandon Copeland, and investment property magnate Danisha Wrighster) to see if they'll bite and buy their real estate, cutting out the middleman entirely."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

According to a report from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gossip Next Door</a>, Sylvia is a hematologist-oncologist. She is a physician affiliated with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seattle Cancer Care Alliance</a>.</p><p>She told the SCCA that she initially planned to specialize in internal medicine.</p><p>However, Sylvia explained, "During my oncology rotation, I decided that I wanted to work with cancer patients. I find oncology patients to be the most inspiring and rewarding patients I have ever worked with, as they deeply appreciate their loved ones and the value of life."</p><p>Per Sylvia's SCAA profile, she specializes in "tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy, a form of immunotherapy that uses your own immune cells to attack your tumor."</p><p>Sylvia's SCAA profile also notes that her team plans to "expand T-cell therapy to head and neck cancer, allowing your immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells in your body. I am committed to extending the benefits of this new immunotherapy to as many patients as possible."</p><p>So while she's not involved in real estate, Sylvia is clearly a high-powered doctor with a successful career.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Do Glenn and Sylvia have a social media presence?</h2><p>Glenn has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter,</a> and Sylvia appears to have a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook page</a>. Also, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Redfin Instagram</a> is quite active, with nearly 76,000 followers and counting!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Everyone asks if the whole show is fake. I guess there are minor, unavoidable, glamorizations -- I wore make-up & it really works! -- but the only thing I felt uncomfortable about was that the army of Redfin folks giving me data & local tips never made it into the spotlight.</p>— Glenn Kelman (@glennkelman) <a href=#>September 1, 2022</a></figure><p>So how long have Glenn and Sylvia been married? It's unknown how long Glenn and Sylvia have been together — however, multiple outlets described Sylvia as Glenn's long-time partner.</p><p>The couple have one son named Oscar.
