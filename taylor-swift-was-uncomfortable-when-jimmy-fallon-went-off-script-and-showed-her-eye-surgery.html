In the following, we'll detail the close relationship between the two, and why Fallon was almost brought to tears by a gesture Swift pulled off at the last second.</p><p>In addition, we'll take a look at the opposite side of things, showcasing the lighter moments between Fallon and Swift. One moment in particular saw Swift completely caught off-guard after Fallon showed footage the artist was not expecting. It turned into a great moment for the fans, and one Swift's mother was behind.</p><p>We'll reveal what the footage showed, and Swift's hilarious response that followed. She clearly wasn't ready for such a reveal, but it ultimately made the moment that much better.

However, it seems like her relationship with Jimmy Fallon might be a little stronger compared to the other late night hosts. That was well-documented when Taylor Swift showed up at the last second after a request from Fallon's team, singing a tribute song to Jimmy's late mother.</p><p>The Tonight Show producer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike DiCenzo detailed the emotional moment between the two</a>.</p><p>“She was not scheduled to do our show today. But we wanted something special for this first show back, so we asked her on a complete whim, since she had been in town doing SNL. She said yes with zero hesitation,” DiCenzo wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“She sang ‘New Year’s Day.’ No one had heard it. Suddenly she sings the line, ‘Squeeze my hand 3 times in the back of the taxi.’ I nearly gasped. Tears. I think everyone in the audience started sobbing. I could see Jimmy silhouetted at his desk dabbing his eyes with a tissue. We all lost it. It was a beautiful coincidence in a beautiful performance. ‘Hold on to your memories, they will hold on to you,’ Taylor sang.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Jimmy Fallon Recalls Being Told To Enter Russell Brand's Dressing Room With Caution Prior To Their Tonight Show Interview</a></span></p><p>DiCrenzo went on to reveal that the hug between the two was a 100% genuine heartfelt moment.

It seems like a particular moment between Fallon and Swift wasn't talked about, or Swift did a really good job at hiding it.</p><p>The interview takes a turn when Fallon discusses Swift's recent eye surgery. Taylor is confused as to how the host knows about it. Fallon then takes things one step further, showing private footage of Taylor feeling 'loopy' after the surgery, taken by her mother.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Jack Black's Unexpected Sax-A-Boom Performance Turned Into One Of The Most-Watched Moments In Jimmy Fallon's Tonight Show History</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor is clearly embarrassed by the footage, but it clearly wasn't meant with any harm.

It was the sweetest thing ever because I just think she couldn’t have comprehended that I would write a song about the two of us.”</p><p>Swift's mother felt lots of emotions hearing the song, especially given that she felt as though it was spot on, in accordance to what the two had been through.
