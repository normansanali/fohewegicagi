His Bio, Parents, Height</h1></header><section class=post-content><p style=text-align:left>Meet Akshay Dhumal who claimed to be the world’s most eligible bachelor right now as he appeared on Sima Taparia’s Indian Matchmaking when it returned on Netflix for a Season 2 on 10 August 2022.</p><p style=text-align:left>Now, in the rest of this writing find all — about Akshay’s parents, his height, his Indian Matchmaking journey, and more.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Akshay Dhumal On Netflix’s Indian Matchmaking</strong></h3><p>During his introduction to the show, Akshay Dhumal said he is a fighter, inside and outside. And only then did he quip that his mom thinks he is quite eligible. Then followed the real part.</p><p>He went on to explain how he mostly has trouble in the dating world because he is from the agricultural, small city of Nashik in Maharashtra, India. The place is far from major cities where he says girls do not want to relocate. And he (of course) can not move from there.</p><p>With Sima aunty, Akshay also later shares that he hopes to consider five things, good education, well-rounded, someone who also wants a family, willing to at least understand the family business, and ready to make equal efforts for their bond. And thus began the real process.</p><p>Hence began the actual process and soon after a meet-up was arranged with fashion designer Devika Vaid as a potential suitor. Akshay, however, simply only felt more of a friendly vibe than a romantic one.</p><p>Around this time, Sima learns that Akshay had a “Vivah Bandhan dosh”. As a result, she actually gets him to have a proper puja done. While Akshay hesitates at first he let his past failed attempts to mingle decide for him. So, he goes through with the worship hoping to find a bride.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Akshay Dhumal Relationship Status Now</strong></h3><p>Ever since this pooja, Akshay makes the viewers believe that he is now more than determined about getting married. Seeming to have made up his mind finally he says to the cameras that he is hopeful of meeting some really nice people.</p><p>So, was Sima able to help him? Did he find the match he was looking for from this experiment?</p><p>As of the time of this writing (August 2022), Akshay despite his recent endeavors on Netflix, preferred to stay well away from the spotlight. His IG did not give away anything and Facebook too was locked. And yet, on his Facebook profile, he had marked his relationship status as ‘single’.

Dhumal is a successful founder and now managing director of Dhumal Industries. He established the company in 1979.</p><p>Lately, in June 2022, Akshay and his father spend their weekend speaking at the Dr. Moonjee Institute of Management, sharing their experiences as first and second-generation entrepreneurs. By this time, this has become part of their professional practice.</p><p>Often, Akshay posted glimpses of his parents on social media, of times he made sure that they are celebrated on their birthdays, anniversaries, and festivities. A couple of years back, he gifted each of his parents separate cars on their wedding anniversary, which is marked by the 22nd of June every year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/akshay-dhumal-bio-parents-height-indian-matchmaking-2022-1-300x300.jpg><p>As for siblings, Akshay has a sister named Anagha Patil.
