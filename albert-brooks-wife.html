His wife, Kimberly Brooks, is a painter and visual artist. The two of them got married in 1997, so Albert was well into his career by that time. They share two children, Jacob and Claire.</p><p>In a 1999 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>, Albert explained, “Life, in general, used to be very lonely. I see people who remain single and immerse themselves in their work and I don't know how they do it. It's very important to be grounded somewhere.” Known for his narcissistic humor, the fact he found a life partner was both jarring and hopeful to many of Albert’s fans.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Albert’s wife, Kimberly, is known for her painting and multimedia. In 2006, she held her first solo exhibition in Los Angeles. It examined the role of women as both the artist and the model through a feminist lens. Kimberly has continued working on various painting and sculpture exhibitions, while also writing for First Person Artist and even presenting at a TEDx conference.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Albert and Kimberly Brooks have an impressive net worth, which isn’t too surprising.</h2><p>It’s estimated that Albert’s net worth is about $30 million, although of course there’s no way of knowing exactly how much money the Brooks family has. Regardless, it’s not too surprising that Albert, Kimberly, and their two children live a comfortable life. Albert has been on the circuit since the 1970s.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Albert Brooks</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Actor, Comedian, Director, Screenwriter</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $30 million</p><p>Albert Brooks is a successful actor and comedian known for his abrasive stand-up comedy persona, as well as roles in films such as Taxi Driver, Broadcast News, and Drive.</p><p><strong>Birthdate:</strong> July 22, 1947</p><p><strong>Birthplace: </strong>Beverly Hills, Calif.</p><p><strong>Birth name:</strong> Albert Lawrence Einstein</p><p><strong>Father: </strong>Harry Einstein</p><p><strong>Mother:</strong> Thelma Leeds (née Goodman)</p><p><strong>Marriage:</strong> Kimberly Shlain Brooks (1997)</p><p><strong>Children:</strong> Two children: Jacob and Claire</p><p><strong>Education:</strong> Carnegie Mellon University</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Albert began his career as a comedian on <a href=#>The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson</a> with an egotistical on-stage persona that inspired many other comics, such as <a href=#>Steve Martin</a> and Andy Kaufman. By 1975, Albert had already made his first film — a mockumentary-style short called The Famous Comedians School, which made Albert a founding father of the mockumentary genre.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In the '80s, Albert’s acting, directing, and writing career took off and he was even nominated for an Oscar for his role in Broadcast News.</p><p>There’s never a lull in Albert’s career, so his constant work ethic easily contributed to his impressive net worth of $30 million.
