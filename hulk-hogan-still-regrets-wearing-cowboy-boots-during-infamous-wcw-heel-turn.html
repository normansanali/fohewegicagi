Unfortunately, he ruined his reputation in many ways thanks&nbsp;<a href=#>to his racist remarks</a>, among numerous other things. Be that as it may, his heel turn in WCW remains a huge event in pro wrestling. In fact, Hogan even has one big regret about that heel turn.</p><p>At Bash at the Beach 1996, Hulk Hogan sent shockwaves across the pro wrestling world as he joined Kevin Nash and Scott Hall to form the nWo. Right before the heel turn, Hogan was very busy speaking to Eric Bischoff at that time.</p><p>While speaking during a&nbsp;<a href=#>Ringside Collectibles</a>&nbsp;video, Hulk Hogan talked about his iconic heel turn. Hogan admitted that he still regrets wearing cowboy boots during the heel turn, something he forgot to change beforehand.</p><p>“When I see this WCW action figure, it actually is funny to me, because now everybody knows what I was thinking, but that has haunted me for over 20 years that I’m going down to the ring, I’m supposed to wrestle, but I was so dumb I didn’t even change my boots. The detail freaks would go, ‘Oh my gosh, why has he got cowboy boots on?'”</p><p>Chris Jericho also stated that <a href=#>Hulk Hogan was always great worker</a>. Regardless of wearing cowboy boots, Hogan’s heel turn completely changed the course of professional wrestling for the better.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>Do you like Hogan?
