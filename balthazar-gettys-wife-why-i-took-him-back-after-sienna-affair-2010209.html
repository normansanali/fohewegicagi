"Rosetta is understanding enough and spiritual enough to let us try. In a way it–I don't know…I feel like we're better than we've ever been."</p><p>The happy-again couple posed in their L.A. home for pics for Harper's Bazaar with their kids Cassius, Grace, Violet and June.</p><p>Why did Rosetta, 40, take him back? "I believe we go through things in a public way to help other people get through it.
