That's right&nbsp;— the road manager was offered a role on the smash hit show, "Yellowstone," but didn't accept the offer.</p><p>"If it wasn't for you [Jenner], I would be a Yellowstone star," Gamble revealed in the Season 4 premiere of "The Kardashians,"&nbsp;via <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>. Jenner's daughter Kim Kardashian was in utter shock after Gamble's confession that he was not only offered a role on the show but turned it down. "They asked you to be on Yellowstone and you said no?!" Kim said.</p><p>That's when Kris interjected and confessed that she was the reason he didn't accept the job. "Correct, because I told him to say no. Because I thought he was gonna have to have a romantic relationship," she said. However, if the roles were reversed, Jenner admits she would have gone on the show without hesitation, especially because of her love for Kevin Costner.</p><p>This isn't the first time Jenner's jealousy has peeked through on the reality show. On a 2020 episode of "Keeping Up with the Kardashians," the momager was jealous of their adopted dog named Bridgette, who stole Gamble's attention, per <a href=#>E! News</a>. Jenner jokingly suggested that the dog was her "competition." Jenner clearly doesn't like anything to derail her relationship, so while they were able to compromise on the dog, Gamble's acting career in "Yellowstone" bit the dust.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxhZ4N0fY6ppqmtnJa%2FbsDVZqqhp6disLC%2BxLJkoJmdl7mmedOuqaedlGKxsMPNZqGooZ6eu6h5xaipZqOinsButsSnpZ6qXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./727012-blueface-mom-booty-picture-leak-jaidyn-alexis-drama.html><span>←</span><span>Blueface's Mom Explains Booty Picture Leak As Jaidyn Alexis Drama Continues</span></a>
