And while options such as CBS and Nickelodeon are available for those who prefer to stick to the cable option, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hulu’s Live TV add-on</a> also serves as a perfect way to watch the major sporting event.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true>That being said, eagle-eyed streaming subscribers over on <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paramount Plus</a></strong> remain interested as to whether or not the most exciting NFL game of the year is available to watch on the platform next month. So, let’s crack our knuckles and reveal if that’s a viable option or not.</p><h2 id=h-so-can-you-watch-the-super-bowl-on-paramount-plus data-injectable=false>So, can you watch the Super Bowl on Paramount Plus?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/super-bowl-lviii.png><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=573 data-injectable=true>As it stands, the football-loving masses signed up for Paramount Plus will be pleased to learn that <strong>yes</strong>, the upcoming Super Bowl can be streamed on the platform. In fact, Super Bowl LVIII can be streamed on any device that’s signed up for the Paramount Plus subscription.</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=false>This is certainly fantastic news for sporting fans, who recently found out that the 2024 Super Bowl wasn’t going to stream on Peacock, which is surely a disappointment for those subscribed to the service. So if Hulu’s Live TV option isn’t a sure-fire way to watch or you don’t have the means to watch the event on CBS or Nickelodeon, then Paramount Plus is surely the way to go for the big game.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ykrc1msKitXayuta%2FHZquhnV2owrGx0WaZqK%2BcYryvec%2BaqZqln6q7tXnPpaysZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1310590-brody-king-tattoos-darby-allin-epitaph-dax-harwood-keeps-rollin.html><span>←</span><span>Brody King Tattoos Darby Allins Epitaph, Dax Harwood Wants To Keep Rollin, Stokelys Slappin</span></a>
