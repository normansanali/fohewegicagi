Casa Amor is the segment of the show in which the girls and boys are separated into different villas and new participants are introduced to “test their relationships.”</p><p>Davey was on the fence about participating in the Casa Amor program, but ultimately decided to go because it was “an experience of a lifetime and an opportunity I couldn’t pass up.”</p><p><strong>“I’m delighted I did it,” he remarked.</strong></p><p>Davey stated that as soon as he returned from filming Love Island in South Africa, he was “back in the gym” with Barry Smith at the Ben Davison Performance Centre in Harlow, Essex.</p><p><strong>“Every day I train in the top boxing facility in the country, surrounded by world champions,” he stated.</strong></p><p>Now that I’m in the best position possible, all I want are massive bouts.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
