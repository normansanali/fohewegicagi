In 1942, one of the most iconic affairs in the business began: Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. They met on the set of Woman of the Year, playing rivals Sam and Tess — who <a href=#>kissed, fell in love</a>, and got married — but decided (with pressure from MGM studios) to keep their scandalous real-life relationship a secret for the next 26 years.&nbsp;</p><p>Tracy separated from (but didn't actually divorce) his wife, Louise Treadwell, according to The Rake.&nbsp;He struggled with anxiety, depression, alcoholism, and "volatile" moods, but the otherwise feminist and liberal Hepburn was devoted to her lover nonetheless. "I wanted him to be happy, safe, comfortable. I liked to wait on him, listen to him, feed him, work for him. I tried not to disturb him ... I was happy to do this," the actress once said (via The Rake). Hepburn was by Tracy's side days before he died — which was shortly after Tracy finished filming the pair's last movie together,&nbsp;1967's&nbsp;Guess Who's Coming to Dinner —&nbsp;but didn't attend his funeral out of respect for his family.&nbsp;</p><p>It's a love story made for the movies and almost made it to the big screen. Per&nbsp;<a href=#>Deadline</a>,&nbsp;Tracy and Hepburn was in development in 2014, but further details have been kept under wraps.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2tmZ4J2e8Ccq6iqo2LEqbuMnqWjp6masW63yKyqoqaXYsGpscirZJynXajBor7SZquop12iwqS0jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-dirty-adult-jokes-kids-movies.html><span>←</span><span>10 Dirty Adult Jokes From Childrens Movies</span></a>
