Nevertheless, that does not mean you have to wait until next season for another round of baking goodness. Because, the show‚Äôs holiday spin-off, The Great British Baking Show: Holidays, already dropped on Netflix on 3 Dec 2021. And the contestants taking part in the UK‚Äôs favorite sweet-filled competition this time are returnees from past seasons. Coming back to see if they can make it in the tent when given a second chance is Rosie Brandreth-Poynter among others and this ‚ÄòRosie Brandreth-Poynter Bio‚Äô below is just about her.</p><h3><strong>Rosie Brandreth-Poynter On The Great British Baking Show: Holidays</strong></h3><p>So, Rosie came on&nbsp;The Great British Baking Show: Holidays as no stranger to the&nbsp;Bake Off having not just competed but also won in the Channel 4 show in the previous series. The passionate baker won the Christmas Bake Off 2020. That makes her one strong contender to take home the crown this holiday season too. And if that happens, although there is&nbsp;no prize money on The Great British Baking Show, she can monetize her popularity outside once out of the show.</p><p>You will see Rosie in the first episode of the show. She and costars, <a href=#>Jamie Finn</a>, <a href=#>Ruby Bhogal</a>, and James Hillery will be under the white tent to make delicious Christmas treats.</p><p>Rosie and her costar Jamie baked together also during the 2019‚Äôs season of Great British Bake Off. Rosie had finished the challenge as a semi-finalist.</p><h3><strong>Rosie Brandreth-Poynter Age</strong></h3><p>Reportedly born in 1991, Rosie Brandreth-Poynter‚Äôs age is likely 30 as of 2021.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Rosie Brandreth-Poynter Husband?</strong></h3><p>In her bio, the animal lover Rosie Brandreth-Poynter describes that now she has her menagerie of three dogs (the bulldogs are both hand rears, and as a result, ever so entitled!), a horse, snakes, lizards, a tortoise, chickens, and ducks. Then, adorably, she also adds that her menagerie includes ‚Äúa very patient husband‚Äù.</p><p>So, we found out, that Rosie‚Äôs childhood-sweetheart husband is Lewis Brandreth-Poynter. And because his social media is just photos of the dogs occasionally featuring him, he remained mostly a stranger among his baker wife‚Äôs fans.</p><p>Still, from time to time Rosie showed him on hers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/rosie-brandreth-poynter-bio-husband-weight-loss-age-2021-1-300x240.jpg><p>The couple has been married as of 18 July 2015. Last year, as the calendar marked their wedding day, Rosie‚Äôs husband took a rarely seen moment from their big day to post on Instagram to write ‚Äî ‚ÄúA lot has changed in 5 years!!!!!
