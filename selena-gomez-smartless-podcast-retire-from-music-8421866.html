But I was doing my TV show at the same time [Wizards of Waverly Place], and I just found it really fun, so I just kept going but the older I get, the more I’m kind of like, I would like to find something to just settle on,” she shared during a chat on Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes, and Will Arnett’s podcast,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>SmartLess</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gomez even mentioned her plate being too full and that she would use work —&nbsp;and overwork herself —&nbsp;in order to "distract" herself from issues she was dealing with.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I went to a mental institute and canceled one of my tours,” she shared. “It just got to me, because I love working, and it distracts me from bad things.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Dana Edelson/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gomez has been teasing an album for a while, however, so fans can expect at least one more from the star.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I do feel like I have one more album in me, but I would probably choose acting [if asked to pick between it and music],” she added. Of course, the hosts noted that she could do both, but she was quick to reply in the most relatable way: "You’re right, but I am going to want to chill because I’m tired.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gomez finished by saying that she never actually thought she'd be a pop star, but that being part of the Disney machine offered her the opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Disney is, it’s safe to say, a machine and, in a way, forcefully requires that I know how to sing so I could sing the theme song [of a show].
