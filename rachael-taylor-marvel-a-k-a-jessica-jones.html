Walker is the alter-ego of Hellcat, a member of both the Avengers and Defenders. Whether or not she’ll suit up in the series remains to be seen, but Marvel&nbsp;does&nbsp;allude to her costumed history in the official announcement, so perhaps there’s a chance we’ll see Walker in full fledged Hellcat mode at some point in the show’s 13-episode run.</p><p data-characters=176 data-current-count=176 data-injectable=false>Walker will be a major player in the series, however, and is described as the “emotional anchor” for Jessica Jones. Here’s the official character description:</p><p>“Trish is a syndicated radio talk show host, former model and child TV star known to her adoring fans as “Patsy” Walker. As Jessica Jones’ closest friend, Trish helps her embark on the most dangerous case of Jessica’s career.”</p><p data-characters=122 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>Marvel’s head of television, Jeph Loeb, went on to praise Rachael Taylor and her ability to handle the complex role:</p><p>“Rachael’s ability to embody a character that must balance both the darker and lighter elements of our series will provide a perfect emotional anchor for Jessica Jones.&nbsp;Rachael blew us away with her grounded, humanizing take on Trish, adding yet another layer to the complex, emotional story we’re telling with this series.”</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=556 data-injectable=true><i>A.K.A.
