Fidough was one of the first Pokemon to introduce Generation 9 before the release of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and after stealing the hearts of almost every trainer who saw one, it’s no surprise that it quickly became one of the most sought-after Pokemon to find first within Paldea. But, if you’ve had a Fidough kicking around in your party for long enough to evolve into Dachsbun, you may have noticed a new ability pop up.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Rachel McAdams Initially Auditioned For A Different Mean Girls Role</h2><time>Sep 16, 2024</time>
