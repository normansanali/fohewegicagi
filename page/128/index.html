0SHARESShareTweet Peter Cavanagh Obituary, Death Cause –&nbsp;As a result of the terrible news of the passing of our beloved friend Peter Cavanagh, each and every one of us has entered a state of intense sorrow. The members of our club would like to express their sympathies to the Castleton bowling club, as well as to Betty and the rest of the family circle, during this trying time. On a more personal note, I will never forget Peter (and Betty), since I started my career as a bowler when I was 12 years old in the old “AFM B” Indoor Bowling Club, which, oddly enough, played its matches at the old Castleton Bowling Club.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Rhydon (Skyridge H27) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</h2><time>Jul 28, 2024</time>

In October 1993, just a few months before his death, Bill Hicks was censored on "The Late Show With David Letterman." This is because the "CBS office of standards and practices" balked at the content of his six-minute set because it "touched on too many hot spots," according to producer Robert Morton (via New Yorker). It would have been his first appearance on U.S. national television.&nbsp;Hicks protested the move, saying he had passed the material by his 63-year-old mother without any offence caused, yet the decision had been made.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What was Korea called before they split?</h2><time>Jul 28, 2024</time>
