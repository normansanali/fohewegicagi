I think it's silly to complain about high end SSDs requiring active cooling.
Especially when it comes to mobile.It's like complaining that an i7 or R7 can't run passively inside your laptop while hitting boost speeds.
Not even Apple's M2 can run optimally with passive cooling only.
If you want passive only, get a WD Blue SN570/SN580. You trade off speed, but they don't require a heatsink, even inside of a laptop.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Aaron Chalmers And Talia Mia Announced Their Third Child</h2><time>Jul 17, 2024</time>
