Like hundreds of other third-class passengers on the Titanic's maiden voyage, Millvina Dean's parents (named Bertram and Georgetta, per The New York Times) were on their way to the United States, hoping for a better life in America. As The Guardian reported in 2009, her father, an Englishman, had family in Kansas and hoped to open a tobacco shop there. In 1912, this prompted Bertram to buy passage for third class on the Titanic for himself, Georgetta, and Millvina, who was only two months old at the time.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Baked Apples</h2><time>Jul 27, 2024</time>

Luckily, it’s really versatile, so I’ve been piling it on nearly everything – salads, bowls, tacos, burgers, and more. Of course, it’s fantastic as a dip with tortilla chips too. Most often, I make this corn salsa recipe as written, but it’s also a great one to play with.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Frankie Gaye - Bio, Net Worth, Career, Nationality, Height, Facts</h2><time>Jul 27, 2024</time>
