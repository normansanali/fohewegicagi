Notably, influencer Lizzy Savetsky was initially announced as a full-time cast member last year during BravoCon, but she later left the series due to criticism related to her religious beliefs. But before we dive into the juicy drama, let's take a closer look at one of the cast members, Ubah Hassan.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Who is Ubah Hassan?</h2><p>Ubah is a fashion model from Canada, although she was born in Somalia in 1987. When she was little, her mother and sisters left Somalia because of the war and went to Ethiopia. Ubah and her father stayed in Somalia until 1994, and then they moved to Kenya. When Ubah was fifteen, she moved to Canada and reunited with her mother and sisters. But when they arrived, they had to stay in a homeless shelter for a year. When Ubah was 17, a photographer discovered her in a park, and she signed with Click Model Management in New York City. She became well-known in the fashion industry and appeared in Vogue Italia twice. She worked with famous designers and brands like Ralph Lauren, Gucci, and Macy's. Currently, she's still signed to Richard's International Model Management in Vancouver. In 2015, a documentary about Ubah called 'Ubah!' was released. It was directed by Joe Berlinger and talked about Ubah's life in Somalia, her modeling career, and her charitable work in Cambodia.</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><h2 class=split>Ubah Hassan is also a hot sauce business owner</h2><p>Ubah Hot is an exciting African-inspired vegan hot sauce brand founded by Ubah Hassan, who also serves as the CEO. The flavorful hot sauce hit the market in June 2021 and quickly gained recognition, earning a spot as one of 'Oprah's Favorite Things' in November of the same year. It had the honor of featuring in the seventh episode of the first season of the popular Netflix reality series 'My Unorthodox Life'. During the episode, Ubah engaged in a delightful conversation about her hot sauce brand with Julia Haart, the star of the show.

The not only serves as an online store but also provides a platform to showcase Ubah's tried-and-true recipes, incorporating all hot sauce flavors.

It serves as a tribute to Ubah's two Virgo nieces, capturing their vibrant spirit.</p><p>Next, is Yellow Tanzanite, a recipe inspired by Ubah's beloved mother and her Tanzanian roots. Made with habanero peppers, this hot sauce boasts a rare and special taste, reminding one to see the goodness in everyone. Last but not least, there's Emerald, an exquisite hot sauce featuring serrano peppers, cilantro, and garlic. Its creation was inspired by Ubah's favorite quote from Marcus Aurelius, encouraging us to stay true to ourselves no matter what others do or say. Each hot sauce jar comes adorned with a unique color label that corresponds to its title. Additionally, the labels showcase a charming sketch of Ubah Hassan in a captivating modeling pose, adding a touch of elegance to our product presentation.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>'The Real Housewives of New York City', airs every Sunday at 10 pm ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqpiku7p50p6YrKeeYn51edahpmaho2LCo63HZp%2Baq6OWu26x12apmqSgnXqtrdSrnKdlnaSxpriMoqpmmZyherSx02arqGWjpbaksYytn6Kml6h6tryMn6arZaSdsm6uxK2rnqo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./woody-allen-net-worth-2022-what-are-her-assets-and-how-much-is-he-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Woody Allen Net Worth 2023: What Are Her Assets And How Much Is He Worth?</span></a>
