Other fans of the entertainer are saying he is supreme, and even Lionsgate Films, who he worked on The Hunger Games franchise for, got in on the discussion and goes so far as to suggest he should be a fixture topic daily on Twitter.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>josh hutcherson is trending like he deserves to be trending EVERY SINGLE DAY</p>— lionsgate (@Lionsgate) <a href=#>May 17, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=689 data-injectable=true>Other thoughts bubbling up right now are general confidence in the Five Nights at Freddy’s film while some not familiar with the source material say it will likely be campy when on the big screen. More love for Hutcherson is also present and, while he has steadily worked since 2002 on television and in film, someone says the coming horror story is a bit they would pray for before.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://twitter.com/jadecdierra/status/1658842920789635073</figure><p data-characters=520 data-current-count=820 data-injectable=false>The Five Nights at Freddy’s film releases Oct. 27. In it, Hutcherson plays troubled security guard Mike Schmidt who starts a night job at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria and has to deal with its animatronic mascots who come to life and kill anyone there after midnight. In addition to Hutcherson, the work features Mary Stuart Masterson, Elizabeth Lail, Lucas Grant and, perhaps in a bid for perpetual internet immortality, actor Matthew Lillard has also joined the project where he will be playing William Afton.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8moqqFlmKrBpLTEq6qopl2nsq%2B10qyYp5uVYsKxu81mrKxlo5bGbrLIr5xmppmctbW%2FjJ%2BpnpyUrsBussCnmK2hk6h8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-harper.html><span>←</span><span>John Harper</span></a>
