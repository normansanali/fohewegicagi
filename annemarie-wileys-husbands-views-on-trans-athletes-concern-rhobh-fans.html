The former NFL Pro Bowler recently addressed the contentious issue, siding with Caitlyn Jenner. While Marcellus stated that he had no problem with transgender individuals, he does object to trans ladies competing in sports against any of his children.</p><p>"I have no issue with transgenders. I do have an issue with athletes who are transgendered trying to participate going from a transition of a man to a woman and now playing with the women,‚Äù Marcellus tweeted in January 2022. ‚ÄúAnd, I will say that. You all can try to Dave Chappelle me all you want. I am very clear on this. You can be a transgender. You can be the homie, but I‚Äôll be damned if a male at birth turns into a female and tries to compete against my daughters. She ain‚Äôt out there. We out."</p><p>He added, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt the dudes who transition to women actually empower women by competing against men?‚Äù ‚ÄúI do have an issue with athletes who are Transgender women trying to compete against biological women. Not against the Wiley Women!‚Äù he continued.&nbsp;</p><p>He appeared to want to avoid any criticism by saying, "Don‚Äôt make this a human rights issue ‚Äì this is a biological issue. Simple as that. Trust me, I am a man." "I hate saying fair," Marcellus concluded on the hot-button topic, adding, "It‚Äôs not even right. Forget fair, it‚Äôs not right."</p><p>Marcellus went on a rampage about NBA player Dwayne Wade's transgender child on his YouTube channel and podcast.</p><h2 class=split>'They‚Äôre about to cancel your girl'</h2><p>Fans of 'RHOBH' pointed out that Marcellus and Annemarie both follow right-wing figure Candace Owens on social media. Joe Rogan is also followed by the ex-footballer. One Twitter user replied, "Don‚Äôt regurgitate hate. There are so few transgendered athletes that it‚Äôs not even an issue." Calling his views pathetic, another person wrote, "Stop HATING on human beings! Sports are just ENTERTAINMENT. Period. And if you're talking amateur sports, then the goal is PERSONAL improvement because in the end, NO ONE CARES. The world's in chaos and your entitlement crys about this non-important issue."</p><p>Another person added, "It's a little startling that someone with an Ivy League education is visibly so incredibly misinformed. I'm sorry but it isn't remotely about just putting a wig on and calling yourself a woman." One person reacted, "You are creating an imaginary problem where none exists. Trans folks just want to live their lives. All you are doing is spreading hatred and fear. We are not out to get you."</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Stop HATING on human beings!

Fans believed that Annemarie and her husband would fit in wonderfully with the other members of the 'RHOBH' cast who had political skeletons in their closets. "Hmmm well she will fit right in with the majority of the white MAGA Housewives or maybe she is kyle‚Äôs MIL bestie ?" Another quipped, "She'll fit in well with Sutton." One Twitter user adviced, "They‚Äôre about to cancel your girl before she even starts filming sksksk."</p><p>One tweet also read, "Hold up‚Ä¶.
