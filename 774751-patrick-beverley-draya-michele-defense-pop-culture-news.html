"Sidenote Yal foul. Not cool, not at all. @GilsArenaShow Yal old asl talking about another man Lady. Not cool gang. @PatBevPod," Beverley wrote on X, formerly Twitter. However many people in Beverley's comments tried to defend Young and Arenas, saying the two men were just trying to "warn" Green about Michele.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Michele, who has widely been called a "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">predator</a>" for the relationship, seemed to address the backlash in a recent social media post. "Get comfortable being misunderstood. Only a fraction of people will be able to truly grasp your essence. You are not on anyone else’s timeline of comprehension. Also, it’s none of your business how others choose to perceive you. Most High sees you clearly - let that be enough," read a tweet from a self-proclaimed medicine woman that Michele shared to her Instagram story.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-london-brown-amp-joe-budden-go-after-draya-michele>London Brown & <a href=# class=text-word>Joe Budden</a> Go After Draya Michele</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, more and more public figures have continued to go after Michele. Actor London Brown aimed his attack at Green by sounding off about Michele's past. "She's passed goods, passed around goods. She done top us all off," Brown said dismissively while primarily attacking Green. Brown is best known for his work in Power Book III. However, he earned his acting start in Ballers.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Joe Budden</a> called Michele a "predator" amid the rumors that the 39-year-old year might be expecting a child with the 21-year-old Green. "We've seen so many NBA stars lose their career, and everything, because of women like this," Budden said. He also went after co-host MeLyssa Ford, who didn't appear to have an issue with the relationship. "We don't have twenty minutes to explain something to you that is right there in front of you," Budden said dismissively. Despite this, several fans pointed out that Budden was also a predator after impregnating at a woman in her mid-20s when he was 39.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Benjamin Mock (they/them) is a sports and culture writer working out of Philadelphia.
