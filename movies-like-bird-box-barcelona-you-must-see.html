<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Movies Similar to Bird Box: Barcelona Must-See Recommendations</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>‘Bird Box Barcelona’ on Netflix is a post-apocalyptic horror thriller film directed by lex and David Pastor. The Spanish-language film is a sequel to Sandra Bullock’s 2018 film “Bird Box.” It centres on Sebastian and Anna, a father-daughter combination who band together with other survivors during a post-apocalyptic situation brought on by the mysterious appearance of creatures that force people to commit suicide. If the horror and family and bereavement themes in the film appealed to you, you probably want to find more horror-themed streaming alternatives. In such case, we have put up a selection of films that are similar for you. The majority of these films, including “Bird Box Barcelona,” are available on Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu!</p><h3>A Quiet Place (2018)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/A-Quiet-Place-2018.jpg alt="a quiet place,bird box 2,movies like a quiet place,movies like bird box on amazon prime,movies like bird box on netflix,movies like bird box and quiet place,movies like bird box reddit,movies like a quiet place on netflix,movies like bird box,movies like bird box barcelona you must see ****,** movies like bird box barcelona you must see" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>The post-apocalyptic science fiction horror movie “A Quiet Place” is directed by John Krasinski and written by Scott Beck, Bryan Woods, and Krasinski. The leading actors are John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, and Noah Jupe. The story is on Lee Abbott, who works to protect his family in a post-apocalyptic world populated by hearing-impaired, blind extraterrestrial beings. Like Sebastian ‘Bird Box Barcelona,’ Lee is an engineer attempting to shield his family from a disastrous situation. The extraterrestrial beings that pose a threat to humanity are another reason why the aesthetics of the two films are similar. The best choice for this list, though, is “A Quiet Place,” which is more concerned with the survival aspects and has its own special lore and mythology for the creatures.</p><h3>Alive (2020)</h3><h3><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Alive-2020.jpg alt="a quiet place,bird box 2,movies like a quiet place,movies like bird box on amazon prime,movies like bird box on netflix,movies like bird box and quiet place,movies like bird box reddit,movies like a quiet place on netflix,movies like bird box,movies like bird box barcelona you must see ****,** movies like bird box barcelona you must see" width=819 height=461 sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>Cho Il-hyung’s post-apocalyptic action horror movie ‘Alive’ (also known as ‘#Alive’ or ‘#Saraitda’) is from South Korea. It is partially based on Matt Naylor’s 2019 screenplay “Alone.” The movie centres on Joon-woo, a live streamer of video games who must spend the zombie apocalypse trapped at home by himself in Seoul. The film, which is similar to “Bird Box Barcelona,” is set during a catastrophic event, and the lead character must take any necessary measures to survive. Despite the resemblance in the idea, “Alive’s” visual aesthetic, Seoul as the backdrop, and the zombie horror aspects will provide spectators a unique experience.</p><h3>Awake (2021)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Awake-2021.jpg alt="a quiet place,bird box 2,movies like a quiet place,movies like bird box on amazon prime,movies like bird box on netflix,movies like bird box and quiet place,movies like bird box reddit,movies like a quiet place on netflix,movies like bird box,movies like bird box barcelona you must see ****,** movies like bird box barcelona you must see" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The major actors in Mark Raso’s science fiction thriller “Awake” are Gina Rodriguez, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Barry Pepper, and Finn Jones. It takes place in the aftermath of a catastrophe that destroys all electronics and renders humans incapable of sleeping. While trying to solve the mystery of what happened, a former soldier fights to discover a cure with the aid of her daughter. The post-apocalyptic backdrop serves as the inspiration for the horror components, much like in “Bird Box Barcelona.” The unknown power that torments humanity is similar to the creatures in “Bird Box Barcelona,” but the emotional foundation of the film is generated from the bond between a mother and her kid.</p><h3>Knock at the Cabin (2023)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Knock-at-the-Cabin-2023.jpg alt="a quiet place,bird box 2,movies like a quiet place,movies like bird box on amazon prime,movies like bird box on netflix,movies like bird box and quiet place,movies like bird box reddit,movies like a quiet place on netflix,movies like bird box,movies like bird box barcelona you must see ****,** movies like bird box barcelona you must see" width=960 height=480 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>M. Night Shyamalan wrote and directed the psychological horror movie “Knock at the Cabin.” Starring Dave Bautista, Jonathan Groff, Ben Aldridge, Nikki Amuka-Bird, Kristen Cui, Abby Quinn, and Rupert Grint, it is based on Paul G. Tremblay’s 2018 book “The Cabin at the End of the World.” It centres around a family on a holiday at a distant cabin. However, their getaway is abruptly cut short as they are taken prisoner by four strangers who demand the unthinkable. Although the movie’s premise is different from “Bird Box Barcelona,” viewers may find some of the concepts in the latter movie to be comparable to this one’s biblical interpretation of the end of the world. Additionally, both films emphasise the love of family, which contributes to their somewhat similar themes.</p><h3>Nope (2022)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Nope-2022.jpg alt="a quiet place,bird box 2,movies like a quiet place,movies like bird box on amazon prime,movies like bird box on netflix,movies like bird box and quiet place,movies like bird box reddit,movies like a quiet place on netflix,movies like bird box,movies like bird box barcelona you must see ****,** movies like bird box barcelona you must see" width=1296 height=640 sizes="(max-width: 1296px) 100vw, 1296px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The principal actors in “Nope,” a neo-Western science fiction horror movie written and directed by Jordan Peele, are Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer. The story centres on two horse-riding siblings who are hunting for signs of an unusual flying object near their California hometown of Agua Dulce. The weird, extraterrestrial phenomenon they come across on their ranch, though, quickly dawns on them as a danger. Thematically complex and different from “Bird Box Barcelona,” “Nope” has scary aspects. ‘Nope’ is a must-watch for all horror enthusiasts since the main characters in both films must contend with an enigmatic force that torments people through eye contact.</p><h3>The Binding (2020)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Binding-2020.jpg alt="a quiet place,bird box 2,movies like a quiet place,movies like bird box on amazon prime,movies like bird box on netflix,movies like bird box and quiet place,movies like bird box reddit,movies like a quiet place on netflix,movies like bird box,movies like bird box barcelona you must see ****,** movies like bird box barcelona you must see" width=819 height=461 sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Binding, also known as “Il Legame,” is an Italian horror film directed by Domenico Emanuele de Feudis and starring Maestro, Riccardo Scamarcio, and Michael C. Pizzuto. In it, a woman named Emma makes a trip to southern Italy to meet her fiancé’s mother. However, she soon finds herself in a battle against a sinister curse that wants to kill her small daughter. The atmospheric horror film “The Binding,” which is akin to “Bird Box Barcelona,” is full of unexpected turns that frequently alter the audience’s viewpoint of the characters. In both films, the relationship between a parent and child is also emphasised.</p><h3>The Silence (2019)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Silence-2019.jpg alt="a quiet place,bird box 2,movies like a quiet place,movies like bird box on amazon prime,movies like bird box on netflix,movies like bird box and quiet place,movies like bird box reddit,movies like a quiet place on netflix,movies like bird box,movies like bird box barcelona you must see ****,** movies like bird box barcelona you must see" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Silence, a horror movie with Kiernan Shipka, Stanley Tucci, Miranda Otto, and John Corbett in the lead roles, was directed by John R. Leonetti. It is based on Tim Lebbon’s 2015 horror novel of the same name, which Carey and Shane Van Dyke turned into a screenplay. It centres on Hugh Andrews, who battles demons who stalk humans by sound while trying to defend his family, notably his daughter Ally, from a cult. The plot of the movie is similar to that of “Bird Box Barcelona,” as both take place during a catastrophe that is caused by weird creatures. Additionally, “The Silence” and “Bird Box Barcelona” both centre on a father’s struggle to keep his daughter safe, which makes the former a great choice for horror enthusiasts.</p><h3>The Wasteland (2021)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Wasteland-2021.jpg alt="a quiet place,bird box 2,movies like a quiet place,movies like bird box on amazon prime,movies like bird box on netflix,movies like bird box and quiet place,movies like bird box reddit,movies like a quiet place on netflix,movies like bird box,movies like bird box barcelona you must see ****,** movies like bird box barcelona you must see" width=819 height=461 sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>David Casademunt is the director of the Spanish horror drama movie “The Wasteland” (also known as “El Páramo”). Roberto Lamo, Inma Cuesta, and Asier Flores play the leading parts. A family cut apart from civilization is the focus of the movie. However, the entrance of a monster that puts their familial relationship to the test disturbs their peaceful and tranquil existence. Despite lacking the world-ending stakes of “Bird Box Barcelona,” the film’s narrative is tied together by a family’s interpersonal relationships as they struggle against the might of an evil force. As a result, although having a very different survival horror aesthetic, viewers may feel “The Wasteland” to be comparable to “Bird Box Barcelona.”</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c9c5dc8e24ec8d74ae07e882d4c2212b?s=150&d=mp&r=g" height=150 width=150 itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Ayushi S</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><ul><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Best Chick Flicks on HBO Max Right Now: Your Guide to Romantic Movie Nights</span></a></li><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Vanessa Papa The Ultimatum: A Recap of the Drama-Unfolding Reality Show</span></a></li><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Best Indian Shows on Netflix: Exploring Rich and Diverse Cultural Narratives</span></a></li><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Best PG-13 Movies on Netflix: Family-Friendly Entertainment for Various Tastes</span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmicn6mwsLnSraaroZWoe6S7zGikqK6ZmsBuuMiknGaamaexbq7OsWSbmaKYsq27zZpksqelYrq2v9Nmqp6dXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelly-doty-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-220428-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kelly Doty Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
