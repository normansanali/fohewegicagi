He died at a tender age of 21 at a time when he literally monopolized the airwaves and concerts across the length and breadth of the country.</p><p>His death shook the nation, leaving several fans including myself devastated. Terry Bonchaka was known for his unique sense of fashion and stage performance. He inspired a lot of artistes despite his young age. The likes of Shatta Wale, who is considered the biggest Dancehall artiste presently, often cite Terry Bonchaka as his influence.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><a href=# rel=noopener>READ ALSO: Actress Nse Ikpe-Etim Insults Man Who Advised Her to Stop Showing Her Boobs Publicly</a></h3><p>Since he died, the SM boss has been visiting his grave to commemorate his death every year. On one of those occasions, he told Jessica Opare Saforo of Citi FM that&nbsp;if he had the powers of bringing back any dead musician, he would choose Terry Bonchaka. ‘Terry Bonchaka is one person I would love to bring back if I had the chance. I loved his style. From time to time, myself and boys visit his grave. We want Ghanaians to remember his legacy,’ he said.</p><p>See below;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/d6a282765a2d5ce4febc0ab1ce945b8c.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/946cfb734faee632916bf9a8f4cf2359.jpg><p>SOURCE: <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jppkpaefoHqiwIytnKuqqWKvsLrCoZikmaNitLOt1Z5kam%2Bpp8BurcWtnKtlmJ7AbrDEmquhZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nick-bencivengos-girlfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Nick Bencivengo Dating Nick Bencivengo's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
