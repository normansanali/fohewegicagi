With the help of their millions of followers and business-minded Momager Kris Jenner, there is no surprise that Kylie is next in line with her sister Kim Kardashian on the billionaire's list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Kylie Jenner Pay More For Her Extravagant House Than Her Equally Famous And Rich SIblings?</a></span></p><p>But as the youngest Kardashian-Jenner billionaire in the family, is her short journey to wealth also fall from it? How did she do it, and can the others catch up to her soon? Here's how Kylie Jenner became the youngest billionaire in their clan...</p><h2 id=how-did-kylie-jenner-become-a-billionaire-so-fast>How Did Kylie Jenner Become A Billionaire So Fast?</h2><p><a href=#>Kylie Jenner amassed her $1 billion net worth</a> when she was 21 years old. Forbes calls her the youngest self-made billionaire ever when her net worth jumped from an estimated $8,700,000 to a billion in only seven years. From 2014 to 2015, Time Magazine included Kylie Jenner, who was 18 years old and one of the most influential teens in her generation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-19.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kris Jenner says that Kylie was cut off from any financial assistance when she turned eighteen. However, some fans are skeptical if this is true, knowing that Kris still handled their business affairs as their manager. But it is enough evidence to show that Kylie Jenner did not depend on her family's wealth for her status.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-kylie-jenner-make-a-day>How Much Does Kylie Jenner Make A Day?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kylie-jenner-billboard-music-awards-2022.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter fans believe Kylie Jenner is making up to $450,000 a day</a>, considering all her income sources. However, Business Insider makes a different estimate of her daily income, which they believe could be more than fans think. Her daily income sparked controversy when tweets surfaced about Kylie indirectly asking her fans to pay for her $60,000 worth of medical bills when she easily earns them in more than three hours. But Kylie did not release any statement confirming her daily income, nor did she address her Twitter fans' arguments about her bills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-does-kylie-jenner-get-paid-per-endorsement>How Much Does Kylie Jenner Get Paid Per Endorsement?</h2><p>Aside from being the youngest self-made billionaire, Kylie Jenner is also ranked second in the number of Instagram followers, following Cristiano Ronaldo. As of April 2022, Kylie has 330 million followers, making her the first woman to reach 300 million followers in the application</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kylie Jenner Has The Best, 'How It Started, How It's Going', In The History Of Reality TV Stars</a></span></p><p>With the millions of views per post, Kylie Jenner gets paid around $1.2 million per post. But her average rate still depends on which social media platform she will post on and how many posts she needs to do. You can only see a few sponsored posts on her Instagram account other than her plugging her businesses.</p><h2 id=how-many-businesses-does-kylie-jenner-have>How Many Businesses Does Kylie Jenner Have?</h2><p>Although there is no official count on how many businesses she owns, Forbes estimates <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie has 120 trademarks</a> on different brand names. Kylie Cosmetics which started in 2015, propelled her billionaire status when her make-up line reached $1.2 billion in worth in 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-16.jpg><p>Kylie then ventured into clothes from only selling lipsticks in 2015 when she collaborated with Kendall in their business called Kendall + Kylie. Still, it did not reach the billion-dollar level as her previous business.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Despite Having A Makeup Empire, Kylie Jenner Says She hates Wearing It</a></span></p><p>Not all of Kylie's businesses have her successful magic touch. <a href=#>Kylie Swim is also an example of Kylie's company</a> that people call a flop. Kylie received customer backlash on her swimwear line when they reviewed its poor quality cloth and sizing. Kylie Cosmetics also had its fair share of issues when 2021 fans now are calling it "not a worth buy" because of its unethical workers' conditions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-kylie-jenner-still-a-billionaire-in-2023>Is Kylie Jenner Still A Billionaire In 2023?</h2><p>With all the ups and downs she has experienced in the last few years, Forbes calculates that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner is not a billionaire</a> anymore—and questions if she ever was. They estimated her present net worth to be $900 million, $100 million less to retain her billionaire status. With a 62 percent decline in online sales of her existing businesses and the slow growth of her new ones, Kylie seems to be struggling to maintain the hype in her cosmetic and clothing businesses alone.</p><p>Other sources have reported her net worth to be as low as $750 million, though this still makes her one of the most successful female celebrities in the world.</p><p>Forbes says, "Kylie's business quietly fell by more than half in a single year," following their removal of Kylie's name on their billionaire list. Forbes speculates that Kylie or her camp may be hiding or lying about the actual revenue she earns from her different businesses to begin. The fast decline of her income even during the pandemic sparked the attention of Evercore analyst Omar Saad saying, "It seems unlikely that much revenue could have evaporated overnight."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, although Forbes has kicked Kylie Jenner out of the billionaire table, her current nine-digit net worth is still enough to sustain her and her family's lifestyle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecqyo6KdXZ%2Byr7rEq2SbnZOkuqZ5wGaZoqScnryvrcirnGarn2Kzor%2FTZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-history-of-baseball-cards-in-japan.html><span>←</span><span>The History of Baseball Cards in Japan</span></a>
