Users were suddenly able to publish extreme NSFW content so long as it was sandwiched between the platform’s slideshow effect. Somehow, TikTok’s algorithm didn’t recognize the issue and the NSFW content ran rampant on the platform for the entirety of Dec. 22, 2022, thus earning the ordeal the title, the “Dec. 22 Incident.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>In May 2023 it happened all over again, except this time the NSFW content was finagled onto the platform in a slightly more creative and devious manner. Later that year, it happened again. Because these foul filters crop up like dandelions on TikTok, here’s all you need to know about them. Proceed at your own risk.</p><h2 id=h-what-are-777-filters data-injectable=false>What are 777 filters?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=622 data-injectable=true><a title=@noahglenncarter href=#>@noahglenncarter</a> <a title="♬ original sound - NoahGlennCarter" href=#>♬ original sound – NoahGlennCarter</a></figure><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>On the surface, the 777 filters seem harmless. Here you have a fun, engaging filter that lets you answer a specific question by tilting your head to the left or right to choose the picture associated with your answer. However, behind the innocuous picture is explicit imagery. When you tilt your head, the innocent photo is replaced with an NSFW one, leaving you shocked and probably a little scarred.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>A majority of the 777 filters tend to be of anime characters, but as pointed out by Noah Glen Carter in the video above, during the May 2023 incident several filters relating to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Princess Peach</a>, Hello Kitty, Mr. Clean, and more found their way onto the platform.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true><a title=@baldnewsnetworks href=#>@baldnewsnetworks</a><p><a title=filter href=#>#filter</a> <a title=777 href=#>#777</a> <a title=challenge href=#>#challenge</a> <a title=tiktokchallenge href=#>#tiktokchallenge</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a></p><a title="♬ Sad and lonely - MoppySound" href=#>♬ Sad and lonely – MoppySound</a></figure><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>Although the viral hype surrounding 777 filters relatively died down after May, TikTok users still find themselves dodging bullets with every swipe; foul filters containing uncensored, inappropriate, and forbidden content continue to run rampant, with more instances having occurred as recently as August 2023.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true>There’s no question the rouge filters on the platform are the result of cunning shrewdness. Offenders have become crafty. Some filters, as explained in the video above, contain names as innocent as “Lennon” which at first glance would hardly strike anyone as offensive. However, when you use the filter and touch the screen, what pops up is anything but innocent.</p><h2 id=h-why-have-the-777-filters-been-banned-on-tiktok data-injectable=false>Why have the 777 filters been banned on TikTok?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@meech_scales href=#>@meech_scales</a><p>Just doing my daily due diligence <a title=777 href=#>#777</a><a title=filter href=#>#filter</a><a title=pokemon href=#>#pokemon</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Meech Scales" href=#>♬ original sound – Meech Scales</a></figure><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true>Every time TikTok became privy to the issue, it took steps to remedy it. Following the May 2023 incident, many accounts using the 777 filters were banned and the NSFW content was eradicated. Without question, the whole ordeal was the result of the infamous Dec. 22 debacle — TikTok users have been taught that the platform’s algorithm is susceptible to misuse.</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>According to TikTok <a href=#>community guidelines</a>, “nudity, pornography, or sexually explicit” is absolutely prohibited. However, since the platform sees <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">over 1 billion active users</a> each month (yes, billion), 777 filters continue to slip through the cracks. Clearly, TikTok has an issue embedded somewhere in its algorithm.</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=579 data-injectable=false>The social media giant consistently takes steps to remedy these issues as they arise, but reactionary tactics such as these seem counterintuitive to simply fixing whatever problem exists in the algorithm. You can have that bit of advice for free TikTok.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8uLTArWSaqpVihHiDjJ%2BgpayVp8Buu81mq6KjpKS4cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./phi-nhung-age-wikipedia-biography-height-weight-net-worth-in-2021-and-more-html.html><span>←</span><span>Phi Nhung Age, Wikipedia, Biography, Height, Weight, Net Worth in 2021 and more</span></a>
