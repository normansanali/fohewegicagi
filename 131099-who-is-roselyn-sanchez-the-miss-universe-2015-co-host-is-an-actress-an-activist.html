The Miss Universe 2015 Co-Host Is An Actress &amp;amp; An Activist</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>To host a contest like <a href=# class=T3D>the Miss Universe pageant</a>, you have to be fun, charismatic, and keep the competition rolling along. Some parts of the show, like the talent portion and bikini section, are boring and/or silly, and the host of the show has to be captivating enough to keep people entertained. Steve Harvey may be hosting the 2015 Miss Universe Awards, but there’s another familiar face to viewers of the Miss USA, Miss Teen USA, and Miss Universe pageants taking up your screens—Roselyn Sanchez. No offense to Steve Harvey, but her wardrobe is a hell of a lot better (though I do love those sparkling shoes, Steve). Let’s learn a little bit more about her — <a href=# class=T3D>who is Miss Universe co-host Roselyn Sanchez?</a></p><p>According to her IMDB profile, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Sanchez got her start, as many actresses do, on a soap opera</a> — <i>As The World Turns, </i>to be exact. After playing Pilar Domingo for a year, Sanchez got — and stayed — busy, earning roles on television shows like the <i>Dragnet </i>reboot<i>, Royal Pains, Without A Trace </i>(she played Elena Delgado for five years)<i>, </i>and <i>Rizzoli & Isles</i>. She can currently be seen starring as Carmen Luna on the very popular Lifetime series <i>Devious Maids</i>.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>David Becker/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>As mentioned before, Sanchez is no stranger to the Miss USA and Miss Universe stages. Though she stepped down as co-host of the 2015 Miss USA Awards due to <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Donald Trump’s inflammatory comments about Mexicans</a> and other Latinos and how they are “rapists” and drug dealers. As a proud Puerto Rican, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Sanchez released a statement resigning from the show</a>, saying, “Although I am not Mexican, I am Puerto Rican and a proud Latina, and [Trump’s] comments were an insult to our culture. I won't sponsor anything produced by Donald Trump.” Luckily for her, <a href=# class=T3D>Trump sold ownership of the competition to WME/IMG</a>, and she can once again proudly appear on the Miss Universe stage.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyf5BpcHJlp528brXSZqmoq5Whxq950pqlnKCVr3q1tMRmpKKro2LCr7XVnqmsnV1nfXKBjJymZqCfqMFutdJmmKdlkZjBs7HSrGSapl2WsLW11aKqrQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-joe-locke-really-playing-in-agatha-coven-of-chaos-the-wiccan-rumors-explained.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Joe Locke really playing in Agatha: Coven of Chaos?
