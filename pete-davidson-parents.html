He landed <a href=#>SNL</a> a few years later, becoming one of the youngest cast members in the show's history when he joined in 2014 at age 20.</p><p>In 2023, Pete released a comedy-drama series on Peacock called <a href=#>Bupkis</a>, described as a "heightened fictionalized version" of his life. And a few years earlier, in 2020, a semi-autobiographical he co-wrote —The King of Staten Island — was called Pete's "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">love letter to his family and his hometown</a>."</p><p>It's clear how much Pete's parents and family life have molded who he is today, so stay tuned for more regarding the duo that raised the popular comedian.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Pete Davidson's parents? Pete and his mom, Amy Waters, were roommates for years.</h2><p>Amy Waters gave birth to Pete Davidson back in 1993 in Staten Island, N.Y., and according to Heavy, she's always been <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>one of Pete's biggest supporters</strong></a> in the New York comedy scene. She used to drive him to all of his shows in Manhattan (and still attends many of them!). She has also appeared on SNL a few times.</p><p>Amy suffered the loss of her ex-husband and father of her children, Scott Davidson, in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which she later described as "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">still raw</a>." She keeps her dating life relatively private, but at one point, Pete brought her onto SNL in hopes of setting her up with Jon Hamm. We aren't sure if Pete's wingman skills were successful, but we're sure his efforts were appreciated nonetheless.</p><p>For years (until 2021 when Pete bought his own place), Amy and Pete were "roommates" — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pete bought a $1.3 million house in Staten Island</a> for himself and his mom to live in, according to Page Six, and although living with his mom was great, he said that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans sometimes sent weed to the house</a> as a joke, according to High Snobiety, to which he announced "please do not [bring weed to my mom's house]. Because I will sell it.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: NBC</a><p>Pete and mom Amy on 'SNL' in 2019</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pete's dad, Scott Davidson, was a passionate dad, teacher, athlete, and firefighter.</h2><p>Before <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Davidson</a> passed away, he was a dedicated firefighter and a well-respected school teacher. When Pete was growing up, Scott coached his football and baseball teams, and also played on a baseball league of his own. He had been an MVP on his high school's basketball team, and played for four years in college, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in history from the College of Staten Island.</p><p>Although Scott and Amy divorced a few years prior to 9/11, he was still extremely connected with his two kids. Pete was 8 years old when he passed away, and his daughter Casey had only been 4 years old at the time. Scott loved playing sports with Pete and Casey, and thoroughly enjoyed watched them fulfill their passions outside of sports. Needless to say, his loss was truly devastating for the family.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/https://www.instagram.com/p/CiX3JyErX9a/?hl=en&img_index=1</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pete Davidson seems to be an important figure in his sister Casey Davidson's life.</h2><p><a href=#>Casey, Pete's younger sister</a>, graduated from Marist College in May 2019. There, she played college basketball and still seemed to be incredibly passionate about the sport, which she definitely inherited from her dad. After graduation, Casey went on to work as a physician assistant.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@caseydavidson</a></figure><p>Pete and Casey seem to have a solid sibling relationship, and she often gives him <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shout-outs on social media</a>. Although growing up alongside Pete was probably somewhat of a wild ride, we're sure it was entertaining nonetheless.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbK1sYydmK%2BhlKi8r3nPmqmepqSo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicole-kidman.html><span>←</span><span>Nicole Kidman- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Marriage, Career</span></a>
