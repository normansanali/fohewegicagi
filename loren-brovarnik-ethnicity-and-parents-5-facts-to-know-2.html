This is generally when it is about her relationship.</p><p>Alexei tells the truth when Marlene, her mother, inquires which regions of Florida they’re thinking about. “West Coast or Carolina.”</p><figure></figure><p>Marlene instantly states that she has no plans to leave the state of Florida. “So, I’m not relocating to a different state. We would like to be grandparents involved and present in our grandkids’ lives and your grandchildren’s if that is any way to persuade you to stay.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=4-her-childhood-was-full-of-beautiful-memories></span>4.
