During the recent fiasco on social media for the past few days, the "Bad Guy" hitmaker faced several allegations of racist remarks, problematic behavior, and a "tone deaf" queerbaiting post on Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Billie Eilish Getting Cancelled? 10 Details About Her Controversial Behavior</a></span></p><p>One of the most talked-about points is Matthew Tyler Vorce, her recent boo. Several old alleged screenshots of the 29-year-old actor throwing around racist and homophobic remarks have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pushed their relationship to an edge of danger</a>. To sum it up, here's everything we know about the singer's most-recent mysterious boyfriend.</p><h2 id=he-s-based-in-los-angeles><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>He's Based In Los Angeles</span></h2><p>Just like most Hollywood actors and writers, Matthew Tyler Vorce is based in Los Angeles. Interestingly, her ex-boyfriend, Brandon Adams, is an up-and-coming rapper who also hails from the City of Angels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I don’t think you should be in a relationship super excited about certain things that the other person couldn’t care less about," she spoke about her ex, whom she always referred to as "Q," on her Apple TV documentary, The World's A Little Blurry.</p><h2 id=he-has-several-titles-on-his-acting-portfolio><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Has Several Titles On His Acting Portfolio</span></h2><p>Vorce is yet to make his big Hollywood breakthrough. According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor's IMDb page</a>, Matthew Tyler Vorce has appeared on several titles. He's worked with the likes of James Franco and Tori Spelling in Mother, May I Sleep with Danger? and with Jillian Alexander in Dark Hours: Typee in 2016.</p><h2 id=they-were-once-spotted-in-disneyland><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>They Were Once Spotted In Disneyland</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Roughly two years after the singer's breakup from "Q," she and Vorce were spotted cozying up together at Disneyland back on June 11, 2021. While the pair have yet to speak publicly about their relationship, they have driven the fans crazy after paps spotted them hanging out while sporting face masks around the amusement park.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barefoot Billie Eilish Looks One With Nature In New ‘Rolling Stone’ Spread</a></span></p><h2 id=the-singer-has-always-tried-to-keep-her-love-life-on-the-dl><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Singer Has Always Tried To Keep Her Love Life On The DL</span></h2><p>Speaking of her love life, Eilish has always tried to keep it on the down low, at least until the recent social media frenzy. Speaking to Roman Kemp from Capital Breakfast in 2020, the "ilomilo" singer said that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wants to keep relationships private.</a>&nbsp;Despite her diva status in the pop industry, Eilish hasn't been dating any high-profile celebs, likely to avoid the chaotic madness.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-one-has-confirmed-anything><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>No One Has Confirmed Anything</span></h2><p>"I've had relationships and kept them private, and even the ones that I've had; with the tiny amount that I've let the world see, I regret. I think about the people that have made their relationships public, and then they break up, and it's like 'What if it goes bad?,'" she said, refusing to shed any light about her love life.</p><h2 id=they-share-a-massive-age-gap><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>They Share A Massive Age Gap</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As mentioned above, Matthew Tyler Vorce is thought to be 29 and is pushing 30 soon, while Eilish has just turned 19 last December. They share a ten-year age difference. Although she already passed the age of consent according to U.S. law, many has seen the age gap as worrying, especially knowing that the singer has been vocal about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">child grooming</a> in the Hollywood industry.</p><h2 id=several-old-screenshots-of-his-past-have-surfaced-amp-they-don-t-look-so-good><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Several Old Screenshots Of His Past Have Surfaced & They Don't Look So Good</span></h2><p>Vorce has also been the latest victim of internet footprints. In the recent fiasco, several old screenshots taken from the actor's old Facebook account have surfaced. On the screenshots, Vorce blatantly used the n-word, the f-slur, and several other degrading terms. He also has allegedly cheated on his girlfriend to be with the singer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billie Eillish’s Boyfriend Apologizes For Racist Behavior, But Fans Want Them To Break-Up</a></span></p><h2 id=in-response-to-the-controversy-her-fans-have-started-burning-her-merch><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>In Response To The Controversy, Her Fans Have Started Burning Her Merch</span></h2><p>To make matters worse, the singer has indirectly called out her own fandom and told them to "mind their own business." She gave her stamp of approval to an Instagram post, saying, "This fandom is so embarrassing sometimes like why would you go in someone's comments and say something that you literally don't even know is true."</p><p>In response, many of her fans have shared a video of them burning and getting rid of any Billie Eilish merchandise.</p><h2 id=since-then-he-s-set-his-instagram-profile-to-private><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Since Then, He's Set His Instagram Profile To Private</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the recent backlash, the actor decided to set his Instagram profile @corduroygraham to private. He further apologized for the past racist remarks for his 40.5k followers, saying, "I am ashamed and deeply sorry that I used them in any context. It is not how I was raised and it is not what I stand for."</p><h2 id=he-s-apologized-for-past-racist-remarks-but-fans-want-them-to-break-up><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He's Apologized For Past Racist Remarks, But Fans Want Them To Break Up</span></h2><p>However, the singer's fans do not care about the apology and called out their idol to break up. Some even refused to believe that the apology was sincere, "He's sorry because he was caught, nothing genuine about it."</p><p>"I take full responsibility and continue to hold myself accountable for my actions," the actor added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Has Fame Affected Olivia Rodrigo’s Mental Health?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBursilo6KdXZq2rbXSoapmpamowaa%2ByKisrGWSpManvsiepZ1lmJq%2Fpr%2BMnq2eqqmptaq6xmaunmWbo7y4ecCbpq6sXZ22rns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./we-ranked-all-the-songs-on-spotifys-life-sucks-playlist-html.html><span>←</span><span>We Ranked All the Songs on Spotifys Life Sucks Playlist</span></a>
