With <strong><a href=#>The Expendables 3</a>&nbsp;</strong>star Sylvester Stallone taking to Twitter almost as frequently as Bryan Singer, we’ve had a number of hints at new additions.

In recent weeks he’s suggested that action meisters <a href=#>Steven Seagal</a> and <a href=#>Antonio Banderas</a> could be in the running for a part. While there’s no confirmation of their activity in the film, there has been another two actors name-dropped. This latest spot of news, which comes from the mouth of Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer, made mention that alongside Jovovich and Cage, Wesley Snipes and Jackie Chan are also firming up contracts.</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>Out of the four names cited, Jovovich is the only actor whose interest has been previously unreported. Cage had already made his way onto producer Avi Lerner’s list of must-haves for the project, and Snipes and Chan have too been rumoured for some time. Should they sign up, they’ll be joining existing series stars Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke and Dolph Lundgren.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=670 data-injectable=true>Stallone obviously has clout when it comes to casting for all roles in the film. Amidst talk that Mel Gibson could be directing the film, he quickly took to Twitter and revealed his love of Red Hill; a film by Patrick Hughes. Soon after Hughes was signed on to helm the flick.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>With the female equivalent of The Expendables&nbsp;in development, we’d have thought Jovovich would’ve signed onto that vehicle. Either way, she’s no doubt got the gumption and the experience for kicking butt.</p><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>Production on <strong>The Expendables 3</strong> is due to commence this August.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopKKknJZ6q7vVqK2im5hiu6qvzqWYrGWTlrSmec2enqismZbBqrvNrGStoJVisrm8xKebmpqcmsBuf44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mark-holcomb-net-worth-168110.html><span>←</span><span>Mark Holcomb Net Worth</span></a>
