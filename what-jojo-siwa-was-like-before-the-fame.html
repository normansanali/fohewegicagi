"Abby would say, 'She can't wear a bow tomorrow,' and I'd be like, 'Abby, you can't tell us what to wear,'" Jessalynn told TIME about stirring the spot. "Then I would come home, and I would be like, 'JoJo, Abby doesn't want you to wear a bow tomorrow,' and she'd go, 'That's it. I'm wearing a bigger bow.'"</p><p>Despite the drama, Miller liked JoJo immediately. "She has that certain je ne sais quoi, and she's shining bright," she <a href=#>said</a> during a Dance Moms episode about JoJo's introduction to the group. This created tension among the girls, as&nbsp;<a href=#>Mackenzie Ziegler</a> and&nbsp;Kalani Hilliker didn't seem to appreciate her presence. "I think JoJo is crazy and nuts, and she talks a lot," Kalani complained.</p><p>JoJo ended up securing a spot on the&nbsp;ALDC dance team but left the show after Season 6 to pursue her career with Nickelodeon. The rest is history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2ljboV5e9ahmK1lmqS3sHnSoq6aZaeWwG64yKScZpqVm7yzsYytn55llpa6pns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vanessa-lachey-issues-plea-amid-love-is-blind-criticism.html><span>←</span><span>Vanessa Lachey issues heartbreaking plea to fans amid Love Is Blind reunion criticism</span></a>
