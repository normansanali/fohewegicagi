He’s often referred to as the father of modern philosophy, as he developed the first major theory of dualism — the idea that the mind and body are separate. Descartes is known for his famous quote, “I think, therefore I am.” He also developed analytic geometry, which allows geometric problems to be solved using algebra.</p><h2>1889: The Eiffel Tower Is Completed</h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-414193 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/part-of-eiffel-tower-construction.jpg alt="Eiffel Tower Construction" width=900 height=653 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-414193 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Roger Viollet/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>The Eiffel Tower under construction.</span></p><p>Construction is completed on the <a href=# rel=noopener>Eiffel Tower</a> in Paris, one of the most iconic landmarks in the world to this day. A large, iron structure was initially planned as part of the 1889 world’s fair known as the Exposition Universelle, and Gustave Eiffel’s design was chosen as the winner. Assembly of the tower began in 1887, with the 18,000 various elements prepared at Eiffel’s factory on the outskirts of the city. Considering the machinery available at the time, the Eiffel Tower was built at record speed in just over two years.</p><h2>1909: Construction Of The RMS Titanic Begins</h2><p>Construction of the <a href=# rel=noopener>RMS Titanic</a> begins at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, Ireland.</p><h2>1943: Oklahoma! Debuts On Broadway</h2><p>The musical Oklahoma! makes its Broadway premiere. It was the first collaboration of composer Richard Rodgers and lyricist Oscar Hammerstein, who would go on to create such hits as South Pacific and The Sound of Music. A massive success, the show ultimately set a Broadway record with 2,212 performances before it closed five years later.</p><h2>1993: Brandon Lee Is Killed</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-315892 alt="Brandon Linda And Shannon Lee" width=640 height=640 data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/brandon-linda-and-shannon-lee.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-315892 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Twitter</span><span class=caption-body>Brandon Lee with his mother <a href=# rel=noopener>Linda Lee Cadwell</a> and his sister <a href=# rel=noopener>Shannon Lee</a>.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Brandon Lee</a>, the son of <a href=# rel=noopener>Bruce Lee</a>, dies at the age of 28 after he is accidentally shot by a prop gun on the set of The Crow in Wilmington, North Carolina. The revolver was a real gun, but it was meant to be loaded with blanks.</p><p>However, it was not properly cleared before the filming of Lee’s fateful final scene began, and there was a dummy round inside that propelled out of the gun with nearly the same force as a live round, striking Lee in the abdomen. He lost consciousness and was pronounced dead several hours later.</p><h2>1995: Selena Quintanilla Is Murdered</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-414194 alt="Selena And Yolanda" width=600 height=770 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/selena-and-yolanda.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-414194 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Facebook</span><span class=caption-body>Selena and Yolanda Saldívar pictured together in March 1994, almost exactly a year before Saldívar fatally shot the singer.</span></p><p>Singer <a href=# rel=noopener>Selena Quintanilla is shot and killed</a> by <a href=# rel=noopener>Yolanda Saldívar</a>, the president of her official fan club.</p><p>Quintanilla’s father had recently discovered that Saldívar had been embezzling money from the club after fans called to complain that they had sent membership payments without receiving anything in return.
