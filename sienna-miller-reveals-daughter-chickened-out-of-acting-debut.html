I realize there’s so many young actors that would just kill to be in this movie and I don’t want to take those parts away from them just ‘cause I can place my own children in.”</p><p>“But in this instance, it was a smaller part,” he added. “I selfishly wanted him with me for the week, two weeks he was with me.”</p><p>Horizon: An American Saga also stars <strong>Sam Worthington</strong>, <strong>Abbey Lee</strong>, <strong>Luke Wilson</strong>, <strong>Ella Hunt</strong>, <strong>Isabelle Fuhrman</strong> and<strong> Jamie Campbell Bower</strong>. Part one hits theaters on Friday, June 28.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasoZWju6J5zKKjpZ2iYr%2BmwsSao6xllJbCqLTTnqlmm5iesKyxzZ6bZqelqXqwsoyamq2hnpx6pbHBrqto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shahs-of-sunsets-golnesa-gg-gharachedaghi-gives-birth-to-1st-child.html><span>←</span><span>Shahs of Sunsets Golnesa GG Gharachedaghi Gives Birth to 1st Child</span></a>
