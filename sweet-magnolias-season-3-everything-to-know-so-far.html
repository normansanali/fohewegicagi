Nearly three months after <i><a href=#>Sweet Magnolias</a>&nbsp;</i>debuted its cliffhanger-laden season 2 finale, Netflix <a href=#>announced its renewal</a>.</p><p class=p1>“We’re going back to Serenity, y’all!&nbsp;<span class=s1>🌸</span>&nbsp;We are so <a href=#>thrilled to share we have a Season 3</a> of Sweet Magnolias. Can’t wait to welcome y’all home,&nbsp;<span class=s1>🌸</span>” the series’ official <a href=#>Instagram</a> account wrote in May 2022.</p><p class=p1><i>Sweet Magnolias&nbsp;</i>became <a href=#>an instant hit on the streaming platform following its May 2020 premiere</a>. Based on <a href=#><strong>Sherryl Woods</strong>’ book series of the same name</a>, the Netflix drama follows three childhood best friends in small-town South Carolina as their lasting bond guides them through adulthood, romance, career and parenthood. <a href=#><strong>JoAnna Garcia Swisher</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Brooke Elliott</strong></a> and <strong>Heather Headley</strong> star as besties Maddie Townsend, Dana Sue Sullivan and Helen Decatur, respectively.</p><p class=p1>Season 2 <a href=#>answered many fans’ burning questions about the previous season</a> before dropping even more bombshell surprises.</p><p class=p1>“I was, like,&nbsp;left with cliffhangers. I was like, ‘Oh, my God,’” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Drop Dead Diva</i></a>&nbsp;alum <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in February 2022</a> ahead of the season 2 premiere. “I was really in it with everybody else. Oh, I hope everyone else will be in it just as much. I can’t imagine they wouldn’t. It’s so good.”</p><p class=p1>While Elliott’s character, Dana Sue, <a href=#>eventually reconciled with estranged husband Ronnie</a> (played by <strong>Brandon Quinn</strong>), the season’s bigger mystery divulged the paternity of her employee Isaac (<strong>Chris Medlin</strong>). Isaac enlisted lawyer Helen (Headley) to help search for his birth parents, which eventually led them to newspaper editor Peggy (<strong>Brittany L. Smith</strong>). After a one-night stand at a model UN conference, Peggy gave Isaac up for adoption when she was a teenager. In the finale, viewers learned that Maddie’s ex-husband, Bill Townsend (<a href=#><strong>Chris Klein</strong></a>), is the father.</p><p class=p1>“I think that she has really made her decision and put it to rest,” Swisher exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>of the paternity shocker. “I think that this season, in particular, there is no turning back, and I think that offers an opportunity for Bill to kind of explore — like, go find yourself, Bill, turn this ship around. Because if there was that nagging sort of, like, possible forgiveness, I don’t think it would lend itself to that growth. And I think it just is important for Maddie, too, to just [say], ‘This is not happening anymore.’”</p><p class=p1>Much like devoted fans, the cast is <a href=#>equally enthused about returning to Serenity</a> for even more drama, friendship and margaritas.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“It’s official,” <strong>Anneliese Judge</strong>, who<a href=#> plays Annie Sullivan on the show</a>, gushed in a May 2022 <a href=#>TikTok</a> video. “<i>Sweet Magnolias&nbsp;</i>was officially renewed for a season 3.
