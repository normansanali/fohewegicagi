On several occasions, her content has led some to wonder whether Addison had any tattoos. Let's take a closer look.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Addison Rae have tattoos?</h2><p>In a video posted to her TikTok account on Nov. 2, 2020, <a href=#>Addison and Bryce Hall </a>did a choreographed dance together. In the video, Addison is wearing a black T-shirt that's tied up in the front, revealing her stomach. Tucking out on her right side appears to be the bottom of a tattoo, which led many to suspect that Addison has a tattoo on her chest that she's never showed her followers.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Although Addison didn't confirm whether she has a tattoo, many fans took to Twitter to ask her whether the black mark on her stomach is some ink.</p><p>“Hiii, serious question! Do you have a tattoo on your right side/ stomach?” one user asked.</p><p>“Is that a tattoo on Addison or am I blind,” another wrote.</p><p>While Addison convinced some fans that she had a hidden tattoo, others thought it was just a tag sticking out from the rolled-up T-shirt. Both explanations were plausible, but there's much evidence to suggest that Addison's "tattoo" was a tag.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Addison have a tattoo in other photos?</h2><p>The best way to definitively clarify whether Addison has a tattoo is to look at other photos that the influencer has posted. In another 2020 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> post, Addison sat poised on a boat and pulled her yellow T-shirt up to reveal her stomach. The shirt was up higher than the one in the TikTok video, and there's no hint of the black ink that seems to be peeking out in the video.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Two years after her IG photo, Addison raised her fans’ eyebrows again after sharing pictures from a 2022 photoshoot. In the snaps, Addison rocked a black tattoo across one arm and an identical tattoo on her lower back. The content creator flaunted her tattoos while also being topless in her posts.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While Addison’s fans raved about her edgy new look, others wondered if she did get some permanent ink. Although she hasn’t confirmed if the tattoos are real or temporary, Addison doesn't have tattoos in any other photos outside the shoot. Her photographer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Davis Bates</a>, also stated that the photoshoot’s concept was to pay homage to Angelina Jolie in her early career.</p><p>“Addison Rae as young Angelina,” the artist captioned under Addison’s photos.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Addison Rae dating?</h2><p>Addison’s fans have also been invested in her life. For several years, she and Bryce were ​​in a consistent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">will they/won't they</a> relationship that began in October 2020. However, the pair officially ended their romance in March 2021, leading to multiple negative social media interactions. Addison also briefly discussed the breakup in her Snapchat show, Addison Rae Goes Home.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“I recently went through a very public breakup. It was one of the hardest things to deal with internally and online," Addison admitted on the show, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seventeen Magazine</a>. “Throughout that time, it was like, really hard to keep it together [when] being asked about it in interviews.”</p><p>Addison continued, “Everything in my life, I try to do with the best intentions, and people like to think that I have bad intentions or that I'm trying to be evil or hurtful when that's just really not me. People only know so much of me, so they like to assume what they want."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Following her and Bryce’s breakup, Addison found love again with Israeli musician Omer Fedi. The pair began dating in August 2021 and have seemingly been inseparable. Addison and Omer are always at a red carpet event and post shout outs to each other via Instagram.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4yam52ho6S7br7AnmShmaaaerWt062mqKs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./audio-reveals-cardi-b-yelling-both-yall-wrong-after-allegedly-fight-between-quavo-offset.html><span>←</span><span>Audio Reveals Cardi B Yelling 'Both Y'all Wrong' After Allegedly Fight Between Quavo + Offset</span></a>
