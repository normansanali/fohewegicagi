At one point, my channel was bringing in six figures a month, and that was ridiculous," she told <a href=#>WealthSimple</a> in August 2018. She then landed her popular TLC show in 2018, "Dr. Pimple Popper." "I'm not getting paid anything for the show, really. But I'm so fortunate to have this — that this has been offered to me," she told the outlet. She also earns money from sponsored <a href=#>Instagram</a> posts, which can net her approximately $13,219 per post, via <a href=#>Compare The Market</a>. All said and done,&nbsp;Lee is worth an estimated $5 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>In addition to her robust online presence, she also sells her own skincare line, <a href=#>SLMD</a>. However, <a href=#>when it comes to managing money, she leaves that to her husband</a>. "I'm still not really good with money. I'm not breaking the bank, but that's mostly because of my husband, Jeff. He really holds things down," she told WealthSimple.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW1maIV6e8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnMrpqhZZSnerG1zKmjnmWgpL2xsdFmoKxlopqurbjYZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./harry-souttar-height-how-tall-is-harry-souttar.html><span>←</span><span>Harry Souttar Height: How tall is Harry Souttar?</span></a>
