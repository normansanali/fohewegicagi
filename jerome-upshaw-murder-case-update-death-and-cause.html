He was standing outside his house in the dark with the cops, barefoot and in handcuffs.</strong></p><p>His imprisonment was due to a noise complaint, which does not warrant an arrest.</p><p>Furthermore, Upshaw declined to provide his social security number or date of birth to the responding officer, Aaron Cody Smith.</p><p>Upshaw remained in his handcuffs until Lt. T.E. Roberts of the Montgomery Police Department, Smith’s superior, arrived.</p><p>The magistrate had answered the phone, telling Roberts that Upshaw might choose not to provide any information to the police, even though it was past two in the morning.</p><p>In her complaint, Upshaw asked that MPD teach its officers how to handle “individuals of all races in low-risk situations” and claimed that Smith had used excessive force.</p><h2>Update on the Jerome Upshaw Murder Case</h2><p>The Jerome Upshaw murder case has drawn attention from the public.</p><p>According to the lawsuit, when Roberts released Upshaw’s wrist cuffs, he apologized and said that many young officers served on the force.</p><p>Smith was 21 years old at the time of the incident.</p><p>Two years before an MPD officer shot an unarmed Black man, there was a complaint against the officer warning of “another Ferguson.”</p><p>Upshaw filed the complaint on August 17, 2014, eight days after Michael Brown, 18, was shot by police in Ferguson, Missouri, sparking a nationwide outrage against police brutality, particularly the deaths of unarmed Black persons by White officers.</p><p>This week, the Montgomery Advertiser was able to access the whole city inquiry file. It discloses that Upshaw, Smith, four more cops, and three of Upshaw’s guests who saw Upshaw being detained were all interviewed by the city.</p><p>It was concluded that Smith had not violated municipal policy by engaging in illegal detention.</p><p>Smith is on trial for the on-duty shooting death of Greg Gunn in February 2016, a 58-year-old Black man who was unarmed and managed to flee a 3 a.m. stop-and-frisk. The trial isn’t expected to happen for another four years.</p><h2>Details of Death and Obituary</h2><p>Unexpected twists have been taken in this murder case.</p><p>Even while the municipal inquiry found that Smith did not improperly hold Upshaw, the complaint and investigation file reveal the views of one resident who believed that Smith exacerbated a situation that Upshaw thought might have been handled more graciously.</p><p>Making contact with Upshaw was unsuccessful. According to the interview files in the investigation file, Smith informed Upshaw that he wasn’t under arrest.</p><p>Smith said that Upshaw was shackled because “he didn’t know what the homeowner’s demeanor or level of non-cooperation would be,” which was communicated to the investigators.</p><p>According to the report, “Smith further stated the homeowner was not being combative, he only detained the homeowner in handcuffs until he could determine the identity for the citation.”</p><p>Smith was sent to Upshaw’s residence on August 17, 2018, at about two in the morning, in response to a noise complaint.</p><p>Upshaw stumbled upon Smith outside the celebration she was hosting for the Southeast Immigrant Rights Network’s annual conference.</p><p>He spoke his name. Upshaw claims that Smith asked for the visitors to be asked to leave and that the music be turned down.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
