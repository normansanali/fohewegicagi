Suddenly, every big gaming YouTuber you knew was playing FNAF, folks were talking about it on social media, and merchandise was pretty much selling itself. The first game’s popularity was just the beginning, though.</p><p data-characters=564 data-current-count=957 data-injectable=true>Quickly enough, Five Nights at Freddy’s expanded into a huge franchise, receiving <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">several more games</a>, books, and a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">live-action film</a> of the same name. Granted, the movie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t get the warm reception</a> its filmmakers intended, but that shouldn’t (and doesn’t) discourage new and old fans of the franchise from diving into other adaptations. For those who love to read, the FNAF novel series can provide an entertainingly spooky time, but before jumping in, readers have to understand how this fictional universe works and how to best enjoy it.</p><h2 id=h-all-the-books-in-the-fnaf-universe data-injectable=false>All the books in the FNAF universe</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Five-Nights-at-Freddys-e1673789808179.jpg><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=573 data-injectable=true>The FANF universe is a large one, and it’s not even over yet. Right now, there are over 20 installments in the franchise, which is comprised of a main trilogy, Five Nights at Freddy’s, and two anthology book series: Fazbear Frights and Tales from the Pizzaplex.</p><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>If you’re brave enough to dive into all of the books in this franchise, it’s best to first organize your reading experience by series, and then go through the installments in release order. To get started, it’s recommended that you read the main trilogy in full, before making your way through the anthologies. Of course, the fact that Fazbear Frights and Tales from the Pizzaplex are anthologies means that you don’t have to read those books in order, but if you’d still like to, here’s how you can do it.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>The main FANF trilogy</h3><ul data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: The Silver Eyes (2015)</li><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: The Twisted Ones (2017)</li><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: The Fourth Closet (2018)</li></ul><h3 data-injectable=false>The Fazbear Frights novella series</h3><ul data-items-injection=true data-current-count=1590 data-injectable=true><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Fazbear Frights 1: Into the Pit (2019)</li><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Fazbear Frights 2: Fetch (2020)</li><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Fazbear Frights 3: 1:35am (2020)</li><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Fazbear Frights 4: Step Closer (2020)</li><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Fazbear Frights 5: Bunny Call (2020)</li><li data-injectable=true>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Fazbear Frights 6: Blackbird (2020)</li><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Fazbear Frights 7: The Cliffs (2021)</li><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Fazbear Frights 8: Gumdrop Angel (2021)</li><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Fazbear Frights 9: The Puppet Carver (2021)</li><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Fazbear Frights 10: Friendly Face (2021)</li><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Fazbear Frights 11: Prankster (2021)</li><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Fazbear Frights 12: Felix the Shark (2022)</li></ul><h3 data-injectable=false>The Tales from the Pizzaplex series</h3><ul data-current-count=933 data-injectable=true><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Tales from the Pizzaplex 1: Lally’s Game (2022)</li><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Tales from the Pizzaplex 2: HAPPS (2022)</li><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Tales from the Pizzaplex 3: Somniphobia (2022)</li><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Tales from the Pizzaplex 4: Submechanophobia (2022)</li><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Tales from the Pizzaplex 5: The Bobbiedots Conclusion (2023)</li><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Tales from the Pizzaplex 6: Nexie (2023)</li><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Tales from the Pizzaplex 7: Tiger Rock (2023)</li><li>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Tales from the Pizzaplex 8: B7-2 (2023)</li></ul><h2 id=h-all-the-fnaf-graphic-novels-in-order data-injectable=false>All the FNAF graphic novels in order</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Five_Nights_at_Freddys.jpg><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=688 data-injectable=true>Aside from its many, many books, the FNAF universe has also been adapted into a graphic novel series, which is currently ongoing.
