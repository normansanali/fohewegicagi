He didn't plan on going to college. He wanted to move to Nashville to pursue a career in country music. However, just days before Luke was set to leave, his older brother Chris was killed in a car accident.&nbsp;In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=#>ABC News</a> many years later, he said, "I'm kind of hyperventilating talking about it... You never truly... move beyond it." So, Luke went to college instead.</p><p dir=ltr>Then, in May 2007, when Luke and Caroline were newlyweds, his older sister Kelly died at home just a few days after organizing a group of more than 120 people to go see Luke play his debut performance at the Grand Ole Opry. The cause of death has never been determined. In that same ABC News interview, Luke said "My only older siblings... gone from the world, in a flash in two, two different, crazy, tragic manners, that... we'll never know and never understand.</p><p dir=ltr>In the meantime, Luke and Caroline have two sons. Thomas "Bo" Boyer Bryan was born in 2008. Tatum "Tate" Christopher Bryan was born in 2010. But in&nbsp;2014, tragedy struck again, and <a href=#>Luke's brother-in-law passed away,</a> leaving behind a 13-year-old son, Tilden, who is being raised by Luke and Caroline. They also took in his late sister and brother-in-law's two college-age nieces, as reported by ABC News.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG9mZ4B6e9OhoKefo2LGsMGMp5yvnaJiuK%2Bx1maYm6elqXqtwcqeZJuqqZa7tHnWop2eZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-tragic-real-life-story-of-juice-wrld-html.html><span>←</span><span>The Tragic Real-Life Story Of Juice Wrld</span></a>
