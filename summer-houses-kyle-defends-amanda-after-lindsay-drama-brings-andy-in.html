She was wonderful at BravoCon, it’s been more when [she’s] caught off-guard.”</p><p>Their costar <a href=#><strong>Paige DeSorbo</strong></a> joked that Batula <a href=#>would be getting an “uncomfortable text” later</a> from Hubbard. “Amanda [can’t be trusted with a secret],” the podcast host, 29, joked on Thursday. Meanwhile, Batula pointed out that her claims were “not a secret.”</p><p>Hubbard, however, was not pleased with the accusations and <a href=#>took to social media to set the record straight.</a></p><p>“I want to be very clear. I don’t work for Loverboy yet showed up to support my friends over 30 times in 2021 out of love for <a href=#><strong>Carl [Radke]</strong></a> and out of support for my friends,” the Hubb House founder wrote via Instagram Story at the time. “Why would I do that if I didn’t like fans? Or if I was rude? Why would I VOLUNTEER to be at more events than I need to? Think about that one.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The New York native also <a href=#>shared photos from various events that she attended</a> with Batula, Radke, 37, and Cooke over the years.</p><p>“Wound up being 3 days (7 total events) of fan events for Carl,” she continued. “I went to support because we had just started dating and I wanted to support but also because I support my friends and their company. I’m so f—king tired of people dragging my name through the mud when I’m nothing but nice to them, show them kindness, respect and support. Clean up your side of the street because mine is doing just fine.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasrZ2isrN5x6isrJ2jYri6uMRmm56elaOxtHnAppinnJFirqfAxKtkpaGemcCixYydqZqlkWKvs7XNoKpmmZ6Zxm61zWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./saju-navodaya-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-560626-html.html><span>←</span><span>Saju Navodaya Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
