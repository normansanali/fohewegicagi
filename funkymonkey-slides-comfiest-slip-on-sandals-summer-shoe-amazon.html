According to Amazon reviewers, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this pair from FUNKYMONKEY</a> is the crème de la crème of the slip-on selection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FUNKYMONKEY-Womens-Comfort-Slides-Black.png><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class=a-size-large><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FUNKYMONKEY Women’s Comfort Slides</a> for prices starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$15</a>, available at Amazon!

There are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two different versions</a> — one that looks like a traditional flip-flop, and another that has a two-buckle strap. Both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">of the styles</a> have adjustable buckles designed to fit your feet in the fashion you prefer.</p><p>If these look familiar, that’s because each option is similar to a pricier pair of<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;Birkenstocks</a>. If you’re trying to be kind to your wallet at the moment, then these are surely a suitable alternative. Some Amazon shoppers even claim they are superior to the original, but we’ll leave that decision up to you. They have ample arch support built into the sole, and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">color and print options are endless</a>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FUNKYMONKEY-Womens-Comfort-Slides-Blue-Flower.png><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class=a-size-large><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FUNKYMONKEY Women’s Comfort Slides</a> for prices starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$15</a>, available at Amazon!

Additionally, there are bright neon options, and some funky graphics! We’re obsessed with the flamingo print pair, and all of the other tropical designs.
