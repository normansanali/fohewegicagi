He is the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, Inc. and refuses his annual minimum wage salary from Tesla year on year, instead of entering into a long-term compensation plan.</strong></p><p>Read on to learn more about the billionaire, his unusual Tesla earnings, and what he chooses to spend his fortune on.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Following the American Dream</h2><p>Elon Musk’s net worth is a reported <a href=# rel=noopener>$65.4 billion</a>, which makes him one of the richest people in the world today but while it’s mostly been acquired in America, Elon Musk actually hails from South Africa.</p><p>He knew early on that America was where he wanted to be and he chased this dream by moving first to <a href=# rel=noopener>Canada</a> at 17, before enrolling at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>He’d begun coding and programming before he was even a teenager and sold a video game at age 12, no doubt opening his eyes to the money he could make from his skills.</p><p>He became wealthy early on in his professional career and founded the startup <a href=# rel=noopener>Zip2</a> straight out of college which was sold four years later, earning Musk $22 million.</p><p>Then came the merging of his company X.com with <a href=# rel=noopener>PayPal</a>, which earned him $180 million when it was bought by eBay in 2002.</p><p>SpaceX was one of his next ventures, which he founded in his commitment to space exploration <a href=# rel=noopener>saying</a> “I can’t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars”.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>“We are going to go to the moon, we are going to have a base on the moon, we are going to send people to mars and make life multi-planetary. This day heralds a new age of space exploration” — <a href=# rel=noopener>@elonmusk</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rdTj0td18V</a></p>— Starman (@RealLifeStarman) <a href=# rel=noopener>August 3, 2020</a></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tesla Earnings</h2><p>Tesla, an electric vehicle company, is one of his most high profile ventures. It’s not abnormal for tech CEOs to have a $0 salary, and Elon Musk is no different.&nbsp;</p><p>He has <a href=# rel=noopener>refused</a> his annual paycheck from Tesla every year, as he has instead opted into a compensation program, at his own risk, which is tied up in Tesla’s long-term success.</p><p>He has a compensation plan with <a href=# rel=noopener>Tesla</a> in which there is “no guaranteed compensation of any kind” and which includes certain milestones that will give him massive payouts if he reaches them. If not, he’ll get nothing.</p><p>However the potential rewards are huge, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Entrepreneur</a> calculated, taking into account his long work hours, that he could be earning $900,000 an hour if everything goes to plan.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What to Spend his Money on?</h2><p>Although his annual earnings from Tesla are, as of yet, nonexistent, Musk is clearly still making a nice income from his other ventures, if his spending is anything to go by.</p><p>He’s not shy about flashing his cash and has a reported $100 million worth of <a href=# rel=noopener>property</a> in California, including a property that used to belong to Gene Wilder.</p><p>He invests a lot of his earnings back into shares in his companies but does have an interest in cars, which is only natural given his Tesla background.</p><p>In addition to his <a href=# rel=noopener>Tesla models</a>, which he’s seen driving most frequently and include the Cybertruck, Model X, Model 3, and the Model S Performance, he’s also owned a Porsche 911, a Ford Model T, and a Hamann BMW M5 sports car.</p><p>It’s not all flashy cars and houses for Musk, but it’s not lavish holidays either. He was open about the lack of time he takes away from work. On ‘<a href=# rel=noopener>60 Minutes</a>’ he admitted that he would sometimes work 120 hour weeks at Tesla to keep the company alive.</p><p>In terms of his philanthropic endeavors, Elon Musk, along with many other tech entrepreneurs including Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, signed <a href=# rel=noopener>The Giving Pledge</a> in 2012. The pledge shows his commitment to giving away the majority of his wealth in his lifetime.</p><p>Learn more about how Elon Musk has amassed his wealth in the YouTube video below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqGmsGWdqrCpecOonKxllaG8r3nMrqqkZZ2WuKZ5wGawnpmiZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./irwin-gaston-ohio-obituary-death-cause-and-annabelle-gaston-manslaughter.html><span>←</span><span>Georgia Sarah Epps Death Cause And Obituary: Family Mourns The Loss</span></a>
