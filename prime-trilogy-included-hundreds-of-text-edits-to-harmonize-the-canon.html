Specifically, Wikan stated:</p>To tell you the seriousness that Nintendo takes with, they had gone through all of our text, all of our scans from all three games, and done a complete spreadsheet analysis on how it all fit together with the Metroid Prime universe in its current state. Every word. They sent us hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of edits and changes for all the text to make sure everything harmonized and worked in the Metroid universe. That’s the level of detail that they put into it. Probably 50-60% of the work we did on the Trilogy was changing those scan files.<p data-v-0018b8c2>You can watch the full video above and we're interested to see how this continues in future entries. While Metroid Dread takes us to the end of Samus' current timeline next month, <a href=# data-v-0018b8c2>Metroid Prime 4</a> is still a way off, and we're excited to see what that'll bring.</p><p data-v-0018b8c2><strong data-v-0018b8c2>Source</strong>: <a href=# data-v-0018b8c2>Nintendo Enthusiast</a> via <a href=# data-v-0018b8c2>Kiwi Talkz</a></p><span class=disclosure data-v-29e62390>Gfinity Esports is supported by its audience.
