Ahead of his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Super Bowl</a> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>half-time show</a> performance on Sunday night, Snoop shared a photo of him and his wife <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Shante Broadus</strong></a> rocking matching yellow-and-blue sweatsuits in support of their home team. That night, the Rams would go on to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>triumph</a> over the Bengals in a close game ending in a score of 23-20. Though it’s impossible to know if Snoop and Shante’s style helped bring home the win, their adorable twinning certainly couldn’t have hurt.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In the incredible couple photo, shared to Snoop’s Instagram shortly after the game, Snoop and Shante twin in matching sweatsuits with yellow-and-blue bandana print and heavy gold chains. The couple, who first met as high school students in California, had the opportunity to rep their hometown after Snoop starred in an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>iconic</a> halftime show that had fans and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>celebrities</a> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>raving</a>. Alongside <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mary J Blige</strong></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dr. Dre</strong></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Eminem</strong></a>, and <strong>Kendrick Lamar</strong>, Snoop proved why he’s one of the most legendary rappers of all time. But in the post, Snoop made sure to acknowledge his love as well, captioning the pic: “King and. Queen.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Snoop-Dogg-Shante-Broadus-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Snoop and Shante’s support would go on to pay off, as the Los Angeles Rams celebrated a big win Sunday night on their home turf, beating out the Bengals 23-20. Rocking the half-time show with confidence and swagger, Snoop’s performances of classics like “The Next Episode” and a Dr. Dre duet of “California Love” were a welcome stress reliever from a tight game.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Though Shante and Snoop’s relationship has faced some rocky patches, ultimately, much like their outfits on Super Bowl night, they’re always on the same page. Shante previously opened up to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>W Magazine</a>&nbsp;about their 20-year marriage, sharing: “He wanted a strong female to lead. And of course, that’s me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5BsZqymn6S9brDOoJ5mr5mbsm6%2Fx5qlrZ1dl7%2BwrcOuqmarpaWys3nBqK6lZZ2WwaS0yKeeZqelqbOqwNJmp6GnpKR8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rakeem-nunez-roches-contract-salary-and-net-worth-explored.html><span>←</span><span>Rakeem Nunez-Roches contract, salary and net worth explored</span></a>
