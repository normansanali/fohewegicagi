So, I should be out, right?” Beanie Sigel asked.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>After Sigel sat down, the pair continued to trade jabs, with Charlamagne labeling the musician&nbsp;“a hypocrite” and “a hater” for how he’s handling his feud with Meek Mill. Sigel then&nbsp;fired back by calling Charlamagne “a bitch” for letting <a href=#>Fredro Starr</a> “check” him and making Lil Mama cry in a 2011 radio interview.</p><p>In addition to engaging&nbsp;in the back-and-forth&nbsp;with Charlamagne, Sigel restated his claim that <a href=#>he helped Meek and Omelly write their verses</a> for the “<a href=#>OOOUUU</a>” diss track that went at The Game, and offered his thoughts on Meek, who he suggested boasts a phony persona.</p><p>“When you portray yourself to be a certain way and that’s not what you is. In music, that wouldn’t have came out,” he said. “Unless the conversations didn’t have transpired. The world ain’t know it’s holes being poked through your reputation at the time … I’mma rock for you regardless, but when you portray yourself in a certain light. Like you going to go all the way right there. And you don’t, I got to draw back.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Sigel also divulged that if his beef with Meek was as serious as some assume, there’d be “no music.” So far, he’s released two diss records aimed at Meek, “<a href=#>I’m Coming</a>” and <a href=#>“GoodNight.”</a></p><p>“Not coming at him in that way. It’s just chastising,” the rapper said. “Chastising in a manner that we do, music. Because if I felt the disdain in my heart towards youngin’ like I did, it wouldn’t be no music, man. Understand that. It wouldn’t be no music.”</p><p>Listen to Beanie Sigel’s interview with The Breakfast Club below.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZkZYVxfY6toK2klWOwqa3RpZimmZejsm6vwKWjrGWSmq6vtcRmqqKflaF6onnHsqeom6KewaZ5yKdkmq%2BbrK6zsIyopWaZmad6p63Cnqafng%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./avril-lavigne-billionaire-boyfriend-phillip-sarofim-split-after-1-year.html><span>←</span><span>Avril Lavigne, Billionaire Boyfriend Phillip Sarofim Split After 1 Year</span></a>
