YouTuber&nbsp;<strong>Tati Westbrook</strong> just created Halo Beauty, which is a vitamin that supposedly does wonders for your hair, skin and nails. The product was released on March 2, but before you buy it, here’s everything you need to know:</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>1. It was designed to be inclusive.</strong> “My dream was to develop a line of beauty vitamins with all of the good stuff & none of the bad,” the influencer wrote on one of her line’s Instagram posts. In an announcement video, it’s explained that the vitamin is “soy-free, gluten-free, sugar-free, cruelty-free, and vegan.” The star of the GlamLifeGuru YouTube channel adds that it was important for her to make the product this way, noting that she “really passionately” believes that sugar doesn’t belong in vitamins. She’s also stated in her previous videos that she’s allergic to gluten. But thanks to the well thought out formula, a wide range of people will be able to try the product.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>2. The formula is “clinically proven to improve hair, skin and nails.”&nbsp;</strong>In her video, Tati explains that if you take two capsules daily, you’ll see longer hair, healthier nails, and glowing skin in three weeks. She’s tested it out herself, and even admitted that she saw results within two weeks.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>3. There are 21 ingredients in the booster.</strong>&nbsp;Halo Beauty’s website is incredibly transparent about the formula by listing everything within it both on the bottle and the site. The website also explains what the intended purpose of each “natural and safe” ingredient is. The first ingredient listed is Vitamin C, which helps build collagen. Collagen assists with growing and strengthening hair. There are also five ingredients alone that combat graying hair. Check out what else is in the product, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>4. It’s been in the works for years.&nbsp;</strong>While fans were surprised to find out that her first beauty release wasn’t a traditional makeup collection or skincare line, Tati confessed that she’s been trying to perfect the formula for years and has started and stopped working on it multiple times.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>5. You can buy it on Halo Beauty’s website.&nbsp;</strong>A 30 day supply consists of 60 capsules, and can be purchased <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a> for $39.95. Don’t live in the US? Not a problem! The brand’s FAQ states that the products ship internationally to “every country in the world except for Balkans, Belarus, Burma, Cote D’Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, and Zimbabwe.”</p><span class=embed-youtube style=text-align:center;display:block></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH10e49sZrCgkal6qr%2BMoZilp12XsqLB07JkrZmknnq4sdKtmaunn6B6qa3Iq2Sso5mjeq%2BtyKWqZq6Zqa6utc1o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dangerouslyfunny-face-reveal-and-real-name-identity-of-the-youtuber-explored-2.html><span>←</span><span>Dangerouslyfunny Face Reveal And Real Name: Identity Of The YouTuber Explored</span></a>
