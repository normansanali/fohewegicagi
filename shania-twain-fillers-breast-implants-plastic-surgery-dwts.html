She’s most likely using the latest technology, as&nbsp;<a href=#><span class=il>Shania</span>‘s face looks refreshed and youthful</a>. She possibly used either radio-frequency or fractional lasers to resurface and build collagen in her mid-face and probably had either a fat transfer to her face or fillers,”&nbsp;Beverly Hills plastic surgeon <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Dr. Payman J. Danielpour</strong></a> tells <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> EXCLUSIVELY. “She has always had a beautiful neck and sculpted jaw line and she continues that here as well, most likely using non-invasive skin tightening such as the forma by in-mode to avoid jowls and keep her defined angle of the jaw.” As we previously told you, <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> fans were shocked by <a href=#>Shania’s appearance during the Oct. 23 episode</a>, when her face looked much different than it has in the past. But her face wasn’t the only thing viewers were fixated on. Shania also flaunted some major cleavage <a href=#>during a performance of her new song, “Soldier</a>“, and fans on Twitter immediately started speculating about possible breast implants. And guess what? Dr. Payman J. Danielpour definitely believes she had some work done on her chest.&nbsp;“As far as her breasts, they appear fuller especially in the upper pole which leads me to believe that she had either a breast augmentation with or without a lift or fat transfer to her breasts,” he says.<p>As far as how much work Shania may or may not have had done — that’s hard to say. “It is hard to determine the amount of time spent and it depends on whether it’s surgical or non-surgical. But, I would assume that she is on a regular regimen that includes skin care and lasers to keep her face tight, and that would require a visit to a surgeon at least on a monthly or bimonthly basis. If its surgical then a 4-5 hour surgery could address a face lift and a breast augmentation and lift by my partner and I at the same time,” Dr. Payman J. Danielpour further explains.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, how do YOU feel about Shania’s recent appearance on DWTS? Do you think she’s had some work done?
