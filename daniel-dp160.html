Daniel believes that the best way to train his Pokémon is a "scientific" approach; therefore, he uses high-tech machines to train them. Some of these machines were seen when Daniel demonstrated his training style to <a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a> and <a href=# title="Ash's friends">his friends</a> in his training lab.

It was shown early in the episode undergoing Daniel's scientific training. Daniel also used Snorlax as a demonstration on his strategy to winning the <a href=# title=Pokéathlon>Pokéathlon</a>. On the day of the Pokéathlon, Daniel got a lecture from <a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a> on how he wasn't being a very good Trainer, because his scientific training didn't consider Snorlax's feelings. After Daniel verified Ash's assertion that Snorlax was feeling tired with his scientific equipment, he started to believe that maybe Ash was right, and decided to leave Snorlax with Team Rocket, who were disguised as massage therapists.<p>When Team Rocket tried to escape with Snorlax and <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Ash's Pikachu</a>, Snorlax weighed down their balloon and was preventing them from escaping. Team Rocket decided to leave behind Snorlax in favor of a quick escape with Ash's Pikachu. Ash tried to use his <a href=# title="Ash's Staraptor">Staraptor</a> to save Pikachu, but to no avail, as it was defeated by Team Rocket. Snorlax, however, was able to save Pikachu by bouncing on a trampoline and crashing into Team Rocket's balloon. Daniel used it in the final event of the day, the Hurdle Dash, where it raced against Ash's Pikachu, along with many other <a href=# title="Pokémon (species)">Pokémon</a> and their <a href=# title="Pokémon Trainer">Trainers</a>.
