<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Tom Bergeron: 25 Things You Dont Know About Me</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><i>Dancing With the Stars</i>‘ <b>Tom Bergeron</b> gives it a whirl by sharing 25 things you might not know about him in the newest issue of <i>Us Weekly.</i> Catch the 61-year-old television host on <i>DWTS</i> on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m.</p><p>1. My favorite car is my 1978 Volkswagen Beetle convertible, but after driving it for a few hours, I crave automatic transmission and satellite radio.<br>2. I was an altar boy. After I learned the Catholic Mass in Latin, they changed it to English. Now I’m agnostic.<br>3. For more than 30 years, I’ve practiced Transcendental Meditation.<br>4. I started meditating because I had concerns about my temper.</p><p>5. I put my fist through several apartment walls in my twenties. Putting a poster over the hole doesn’t get you your security deposit back.<br>6. I’m a gym rat.<br>7. I never got a college degree because I was already working in radio when I graduated from high school.<br>8. I meditate in my dressing room before every <i>Dancing With the Stars </i>broadcast, between the dress rehearsal and the live show.<br>9. I love hosting live television.<br>10. But I’m not great at social gatherings.</p><p>11. When my wife was pregnant with our first daughter, I knew the sex of the baby for six months, but she didn’t!<br>12. I’m good at keeping secrets.<br>13. I have no dance ability unless tequila is involved.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/tom-lead-37cc9dab-7336-4ed7-bc40-f04664fc4111.jpg><p>14. I’ve only watched one <i>DWTS</i> episode in 12 years and only about a half dozen <i>America’s Funniest Home Videos</i> episodes over the 15 years I hosted that show.<br>15. I hate watching myself on television. I barely enjoy watching myself shave.<br>16. I was the first person to appear on camera on the FX network. I welcomed viewers to the new network in 1994 with the morning show <i>Breakfast Time.</i><br>17. <i>Breakfast Time</i> is still my favorite TV experience.<br>18. I start every morning with a Starbucks Venti iced coffee.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/tom-charo-1a99f095-8d18-4e23-b795-7833272c4372.jpg><p>19. I’m addicted to Angry Birds and Spider Solitaire.<br>20. I had a carefully catalogued comic book collection as a kid. I was always a Marvel guy.<br>21. At 16, I stupidly sold the entire collection for about $20. I thought I’d feel more mature.<br>22. I taped interviews with Moe Howard and Larry Fine of The Three Stooges when I was 16. <b>Howard Stern</b> and I turned them into a special on his SiriusXM channel back in 2009.<br>23. I never realized how long a list of 25 things could feel.<br>24. I was sure <i>DWTS </i>would only be a summer fill-in show.<br>25. I’d make a lousy psychic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatp51ir6a%2Bxp6pqKZdZ4JuwMeipaCrXa68tnnDqKWtZZujvLh5wJumrqxdorJuw5Nwa29uaGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lady-gaga-harley-quinn-on-set-photos-joker-sequel-7371363.html><span>←</span><span>The First On-Set Photos of Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn Are Here</span></a>
