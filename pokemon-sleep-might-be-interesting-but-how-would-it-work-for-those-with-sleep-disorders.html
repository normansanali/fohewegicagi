Using your tracked sleeping data, three types of Pok√©mon would emerge. However, that‚Äôs only if you had a good night‚Äôs sleep. What about those with insomnia? Or perhaps those prone to nightmares? How would the game work for them? Unfortunately, that hasn‚Äôt been revealed, and those with sleeping disorders fear that they may be missing out on cool Pok√©mon due to lack of a good night‚Äôs rest.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>When you miss out on a time-exclusive shiny in Pokemon sleep because your insomnia kicks in <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/lN0sUPVgcY</a></p>‚Äî BigRig Creates (@BigRigCreates) <a href=#>February 27, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>So if someone has insomnia, does that mean they're playing Pokemon Sleep on hard mode?</p>‚Äî Majora (@VTBMajora) <a href=#>February 27, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>When you're excited to play Pokemon Sleep, but you forgot that you have insomia <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/NTnde2eWGE</a></p>‚Äî TheRavingTimes (@TheRavingTimes) <a href=#>February 27, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>While The Pok√©mon Company has not revealed how the game would work for those who struggle to get a good night‚Äôs rest, fans joked about how Pok√©mon was able to cure a sleeping disorder through a simple video game instead of proper medication.
