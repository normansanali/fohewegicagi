Kourt is currently in Brooklyn supporting her husband Travis Barker and his boys, Blink-182, as they perform a few shows in Brooklyn. And while she's in the Big Apple, it appears she's swapped out her flashy, over-the-top outfits for a low-key combination of Dickies overalls (anyone hoping to get the same <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Classic Bib Overalls in Rinsed Black</a>&nbsp;definitely can) and a beat-up band T-shirt featuring her beau's band.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gotham/GC Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But lest we think she's completely shed her Calabasas gloss, Kourtney paired the very accessible look with a black Hermès bag and a pair of chunky black boots with an exaggerated, architectural sole. She finished her outfit with a sleek, middle-parted hairstyle, and she matched her fiery red manicure to the Dickies logo on her bib overalls. Tiny sunglasses were the finishing touch, along with a soft rosy lip color.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gotham/GC Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If the look is giving you a case of déjà vu, Kardashian-Barker actually wore the outfit earlier this month, only the colors were swapped. Instead of black overalls, she wore an off-white one-piece from Carhartt with a black T-shirt underneath. And instead of boots, she wore pointy white pumps and carried the same top-handle bag. Fans can&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>snag that look</a>&nbsp;for less than a Kardashian-approved bandage dress, too, and the best part may just be that they're not sold out, ever.&nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yqisq6yemsZut8Crm5qrmJ6ur3nDopqkoZWoerDCxKuYpaSjYq%2Bttc2kZGpwYmLBbr%2FHoqmtZWdqfXV9lnI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kevin-morrow-named-president-of-live-nation-new-york.html><span>←</span><span>Kevin Morrow Named President Of Live Nation New York</span></a>
