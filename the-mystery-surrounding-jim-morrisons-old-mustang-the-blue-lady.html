Others attest that Morrison left it at Los Angeles International Airport while on tour, and it was towed and sold at a public auction. Others say that Morrison totaled his beloved Mustang, and it was crushed for scrap. Whatever the case, if anyone does find The Blue Lady — if it's even there to be found — it would no doubt be one of the most valuable Mustangs in the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDkG1pb29fqbWmecyyqq2doq56tMHRq6auppSeu6h5yaKkZqWfp7%2Bqv86nqmannJl6rsHSrZinn12ptaZ5waWsnmWclrG6ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-the-abduction-of-jennifer-grayson-based-on-a-true-story.html><span>←</span><span>The Abduction of Jennifer Grayson: A True Story?</span></a>
