He played from 1989 to 1999, and all of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Daryl Johnston?

After matriculating, he attended Syracuse University and was red shirted during his freshman year. He played on special teams and would eventually become the starting fullback in 1986. He became an All-Big East selection during his junior year, and was named an All-American in his senior year. He gained the most yards rushing by a Syracuse running back, breaking <a href=#>Larry Csonka’s</a> collegiate record. He graduated with a degree in economics, and then joined the 1989 NFL Draft.</p><p>He was selected in the second round by the Dallas Cowboys, and was given the nickname “Moose” due to his large size. He played in 149 consecutive games for the Cowboys and became one of the greatest special teams players in franchise history, scoring 22 career touchdowns and having 294 receptions, the third highest among the teams’ running backs. Thanks to his contributions, his net worth increased constantly and the fullback position was offered in the Pro Bowl. In 1993, he would become the first fullback ever selected to the Pro Bowl, earning return trips in the next two years. After suffering a neck injury, he retired at the end of the 1999 season. During his NFL career, he was part of three Super Bowl winning teams – XXVII, XXVIII, XXX.</p><p>In 2003, Daryl then joined Fox Sports Radio program “Players Inc Radio” which was sponsored by NFL Players Inc. He has continued in broadcasting work which increased his net worth further. A decade later, he became a color commentator of “The NFL on Fox”, and also became an analyst of the NFL Network show “Total Access”. He’s also one of the announcers of the Cotton Bowl Classic, and made a guest appearance in the television series “Wishbone”.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Johnston has been married to Diane Krebs since 1996, and they have two children.
