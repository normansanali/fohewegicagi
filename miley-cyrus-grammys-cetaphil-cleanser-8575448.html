It’s like you're cleansing yourself of all of the bad you might have dealt with hours before. But regardless of how your day went, washing your face and hopping into bed with a clean, refreshed complexion is simply ahhhh-evoking — with the right face wash, that is.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It can be hard to find a face cleanser that you really love. Some you might just like; others you will absolutely hate, and others are simply so-so. It can take time, money, and effort to find one that works for you, but how wonderful is it to know that the best of the best is sitting in your local drugstore — for less than <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">$15 a pop</a>, at that.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The famous <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Cetaphil cream-to-foam face wash</a> has probably been on your radar for years — nay, decades — and that’s because it's existed for so long. The brand was founded more than 75 years ago, with the hero product being a gentle face cleanser that was specifically created for people with sensitive skin. I’ve used it! My sister, who has acne-prone skin, has used it! And celebrity makeup artist, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>James Kaliardos</a>, used it on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Miley Cyrus</a> prior to doing her Grammys makeup!&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cetaphil-cream-to-foam-cleanser></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cetaphil Cream-to-Foam Cleanser&nbsp;</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kaliardos shared with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Who What Wear</a> the goal for Cyrus’ Grammys look was fresh-faced and glowy, and as we all know, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a yummy-for-you skin cleanser</a> is the key to achieving just that. It should not only cleanse, but also hydrate and calm any irritation — and that’s exactly what this Cetaphil cleanser does.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I used a true favorite, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Cetaphil</a>. I wanted the skin to feel clean, hydrated, and soothed," he says, noting it has “aloe and vitamin B, which leaves the skin feeling refreshed." This classic, trusty cleanser is packed with gentle ingredients, given its suitability for sensitive skin, including the aforementioned goodies that hydrate, soothe, and preserve the skin barrier. Sounds ahh-worthy, right? Right.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It’s not just pros who approve of it, either. So many people, including shopping editors like myself and hundreds of Amazon reviewers, agree that this is the GOAT. It has been around for pretty long, so there’s that, but there’s a reason it’s stood the test of time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“This face wash has really been improving my skin,” <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">read one review</a>. “My skin is always feeling refreshed, clean, and most of all: hydrated!” Another noted, “<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">This face cleaner is amazing</a>! It has helped with breakouts and is very easy to use. It improved the overall look of my skin.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For a non-fussy, get-it-done type of cleanser, Cetaphil has your back (err, face?)
