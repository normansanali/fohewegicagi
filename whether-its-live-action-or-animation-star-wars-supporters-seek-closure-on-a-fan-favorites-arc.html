She has since appeared in comic books and novels, and she is one of the central antagonists of Star Wars: The Clone Wars. While she was voiced by Grey DeLisle in the original series and Nika Futterman in The Clone Wars, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">originally her character was supposed to be one of the main antagonists</a> in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Star-Wars-The-Clone-Wars-Asajj-Ventress.jpg><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>Despite her missing out on a live-action debut, the Sith assassin and one-time apprentice to Count Dooku is one of the more popular characters among fans of the series. However, her story, while intended to be finished in the final season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, was relegated to a novel in 2015, Star Wars: Dark Disciple by Christie Golden.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>One Redditor has wished for this story not just to be stuck on the page, asking for a live-action or animated accounting of the end of Asajj Ventress. They wrote, “I love Assaj, she’s one of my fav Clone Wars characters, and it’s sad that I have to read a novel to learn what happened to her after watching her story through the seasons.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Asajj Ventress deserves her story to end in a TV series</a> from <a href=#>StarWars</a></figure><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=192 data-injectable=false>Fans seem to be on their side, with one pointing out that a place for the story in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney Plus</a>’ lineup could already exist, with “We could get it in future seasons of Tales of the Jedi.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>CT-24-0408’s comment from discussion "Asajj Ventress deserves her story to end in a TV series"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>The upcoming series of shorts contained in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of the Jedi</a> tell two stories split between six episodes. The stories follow two characters throughout their lives, Count Dooku and Ahsoka Tano. It would make sense for a possible second season of the series to at least partially cover the story of Asajj Ventress.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FT427jJVsAAOk3e.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FT427jIVIAAvGWV.jpeg><p data-characters=526 data-current-count=844 data-injectable=true>Interestingly, these Star Wars fans might actually get what they want for a change. The Disney Plus series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> teased Quinlan Vos as someone who was helping people survive against the Empire. With Disney mining the Star Wars prequels dry for content with Obi-Wan Kenobi and the upcoming Ahsoka series, it would not be too outrageous to suggest that we could get a Quinlan Vos series. And seeing as Ventress dies protecting Vos, it would make sense for Disney to adapt the story if they do make a Quinlan Vos series.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>But not every fan agrees with the original poster, with one fan putting their weight behind the source material, “Dark Disciple is probably the best book of the Disney canon. She doesn’t need a tv show. Read.” Sure, that might be a controversial take, but Dark Disciple is considered canon, and at least one person in the thread vouches for it.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>GeneralPokey’s comment from discussion "Asajj Ventress deserves her story to end in a TV series"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=171 data-injectable=false>Wherever you fall on her story being adapted, one thing is for sure, fans of Star Wars: The Clone Wars want to make sure that we haven’t seen the last of Asajj Ventress.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMStn56qXZ7BtHnLoq2eZZGYwaq7zWamq2WRo7aurdOipqdlo6mus3nWmqmsZaOqvbG70a2cq6tdqLKmt4yco6irpaeybrvNZphmnpGjeqet1aipoqyVqHqivsJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-lopez-favorite-fall-boot-6753503.html><span>←</span><span>Shop Jennifer Lopezs Favorite Fall Boots From DSW</span></a>
