The most perfect s’mores and chocolate chip cookie in one!</p><p>It’s 4th of July week here on Modern Honey and I am starting it out by sharing one of our all-time favorite cookies — <strong>the Chocolate Chip Marshmallow Fluff Smore Cookie.</strong> When we go on vacation, we are always gathering all of the items to make s’mores by a campfire. Since I am a chocolate chip cookie freak…I thought why not combine all the good things into one?&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Chocolate-Chip-Smores-Cookies-12-edit-scaled.jpg alt="Chocolate Chip S'mores Cookies Warm milk chocolate chip cookies with creamy marshmallow fluff and graham cracker.

It has <strong>creamy milk chocolate, ooey-gooey marshmallow, and crunchy graham crackers</strong> in the most perfect chocolate chip cookie. Forget the smores! Bring on the chocolate chip smores cookie.</p><p>I did a lot of recipe testing to get this just right. I started out with my classic chocolate chip cookie dough. I topped the cookies with sliced large marshmallows and baked them. They were good but the marshmallows got a little too toasty and hardened up when they cooled. Back to the drawing board!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Chocolate-Chip-Smores-Cookies-11-scaled.jpg alt="Chocolate Chip S'mores Cookies Warm milk chocolate chip cookies with creamy marshmallow fluff and graham cracker.

Since it was a creamier version of a marshmallow, I thought it wouldn’t get as hard when baked. I was right! I did try two methods though to see which one fared better. The first method was to roll the cookie dough into balls and then press a well into the center. I put a dollop of marshmallow fluff in the center and the slightly covered some of it with cookie dough around the sides. I baked the cookies and they came out perfect. The marshmallow fluff became a little bit toasty and slightly hardened just on the outside, while the inside still remained ooey-gooey.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Chocolate-Chip-Smores-Cookies-25-crop-scaled.jpg alt="Chocolate Chip S'mores Cookies Warm milk chocolate chip cookies with creamy marshmallow fluff and graham cracker.

I wanted to see how it would work if I removed the cookies with two minutes left of baking time and added a dollop of marshmallow fluff on the top and the milk chocolate and graham cracker chunks. I returned them to the oven and baked them for two minutes longer to begin to melt the milk chocolate chunks. The marshmallow came out super soft without any hardness around the edges.</p><p>I have to be honest here…both methods work. I wouldn’t suggest using marshmallows unless you add them add the very end. That would work but they wouldn’t be as soft as marshmallow fluff.&nbsp;</p><p>I made <strong>my own marshmallow fluff from scratch</strong>&nbsp;using this recipe —<span> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HOMEMADE MARSHMALLOW FLUFF</strong></a> </span>which was downright heavenly but you can save yourself some serious time and buy it at the grocery store.

Cream butter and sugars for at least 4 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl to ensure even creaming. I suggest cutting the butter into cubes to allow for easier creaming.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Stir in milk chocolate chips</strong>. My favorite chocolate chips are Guittard. I like to use a combination of milk chocolate chips and chunks. I cut up chunks of Trader Joe’s Pound Plus Bar to add to the cookies as soon as they come out of the oven.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>While the cookies are baking, get the marshmallow fluff, milk chocolate chunks, and pieces of graham cracker ready</strong>. As soon as you remove the cookies from the oven, add a dollop of marshmallow fluff, press in the chunks of chocolate, and add a few pieces of graham cracker.</li><li><strong>Let set up for at least 10 minutes before eating to allow the cookies to cool</strong>.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Chocolate-Chip-Smores-Cookies-Recipe.png alt="Chocolate Chip S'mores Cookies Warm milk chocolate chip cookies with creamy marshmallow fluff and graham cracker.
