Towards the end of the video she even briefly air-guitared along with the iconic guitarist’s tune. For most of the clip, Brit was dancing barefoot, but near the end there was a moment where she sported some high white boots.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The singer is clearly fond of the outfit. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Britney</a> posted a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>few videos</a> to Instagram of her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dancing to other songs</a> in the same bikini bottoms, top, and boots back at the beginning of July, and even earlier back in April. It’s definitely a favorite look for dancing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/britney-spears-dance-pink-bikini-video-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>While Britney shares dancing videos somewhat regularly, she has a little bit more to dance about this month. A week prior, she released her new single “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mind Your Business,”</a> a collaboration with rapper&nbsp;<strong>Will.I.Am,&nbsp;</strong>who she had previously teamed up with for the 2013 song “Scream And Shout.” The new tune dropped on July 21.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Before the tune hit streaming services, Will admitted that he was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>thrilled to get to reunite</a> with Britney for a new song. “Dancing is therapy for lots of people; people that make music, people that listen to music,” he said during a&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS This Morning</a>&nbsp;interview. “I see that every time I see [Britney] dance on her Instagram, I light up because I see how much she loves music.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“Mind Your Business” is the second song Britney has put out since she was released from her conservatorship in November 2021. Her first track was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Hold Me Closer,”</a> a collaboration with&nbsp;<strong>Elton John,&nbsp;</strong>based on his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>classic song “Tiny Dancer.”&nbsp;</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5FxZpuqmam7psWMrKeemaKoerG1zaRkm6GbnruqecGoq62nnah6pa3NnJxmq5GjwaK6wGatopyVpHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./austin-williams.html><span>←</span><span>Austin Williams | Fan Arch</span></a>
