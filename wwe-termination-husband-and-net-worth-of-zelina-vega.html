Despite being a professional wrestler in the United States, she is also a manager and an actress. Vega signed with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2017 and wrestled under the Raw brand as Zelina Vega.</strong></p><p>She also worked in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) under the ring name Rosita and various independent promotions under her real name before joining WWE. In 2011, wrestling magazine Pro Wrestling Illustrated named Zelina Vega “Inspirational Wrestler of the Year.”</p><p>Furthermore, all of the controversies have put a halt to her wrestling career after she was finally allowed to demonstrate her talent as a wrestler after primarily working as a manager. How did it happen that WWE’s valuable present and future are no longer with the company?</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Zelina_Vega_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Zelina Vega? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>In her brief boxing career, Vega has also gained popularity and fame. She was regarded as WWE’s future face before her dismissal. Similarly, Vega’s net worth is estimated to be around <strong>$2 million</strong> as of April 2020. Wrestlers also receive base annual wages and bonuses.</p><p>The average WWE wrestler on the roster earns between $500,000 and $1 million per year. Aside from wrestling, Vega has several brand endorsements, including Trifecta Nutrition, Nails by Leishka, Jessica Angel collection, and others, which earn her extra money.</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Zelina_Vega_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Zelina Vega born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>Zelina Vega, a former WWE star, was born on <strong>December 27, 1990,</strong> in Queens, New York, and is of Puerto Rican descent. She is the oldest child of her parents, Michael and Monique Trinidad. Similarly, Timothy Trinidad is Vega’s younger brother, and they grew up watching professional wrestling together, which is where she developed her wrestling interest.</p><p>Vega’s parents divorced when she and her brother were young, but their relationship was peaceful. Similarly, her father worked as a telecom analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald at the World Trade Center and was killed in the September 11 terrorist attack.</p><p>Her father’s death devastated her and her family. She used to swim and play baseball at school as a young girl, but her passion led her to wrestle more. Vega also claims that her father inspired and motivated her to pursue a career in boxing. NBC featured her in a special issue titled 9/11 Children.</p><p>Given the loss suffered by many people on that fateful day, Vega worked as a camp counselor for children whose parents were killed in the 9/11 terrorist attack. Similarly, she demonstrated her involvement in various charitable causes such as Habitat for Humanity.</p><p>Zelina’s birth chart indicates that she was born under the sign of Capricorn. Capricorns are known for their ambition, goal-oriented nature, and willingness to work hard.</p><p>It also fits her personality, as Vega is known for making a distinct mark in her short time in business.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style="width:80%;margin:0 auto" width=100%><tbody><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Birth Name</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Thea Megan Trinidad</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Birth Date</strong></td><td style=height:24px>December 27, 1990</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Age</strong></td><td style=height:24px>30 years</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Queens, New York</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Current Residence</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Tampa, Florida</td></tr><tr style=height:96px><td style=height:96px><strong>Ring Name</strong></td><td style=height:96px>Zelina Vega (IN WWE)<br>Divina Fly<br>Rosita (In TNA)<br>Thea Trinidad</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Religion</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Not Known</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td style=height:24px>American</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Latin (White)</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Education</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Not Known</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Horoscope</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Capricorn</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Michael Angel Trinidad</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Mother’s Name</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Monique Trinidad</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td style=height:24px>One (Brother)</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Siblings Name</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Timothy Trinidad</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Height</strong></td><td style=height:24px>5 feet 1 inch (155 cm)</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Weight</strong></td><td style=height:24px>65 kg (143 lbs)</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Build</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Athlete</td></tr><tr style=height:72px><td style=height:72px><strong>Body Measurement</strong></td><td style=height:72px>Chest: 38 Inches<br>Waist: 29 Inches<br>Hips: 37 Inches</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Eye color</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Black</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Bra Cup Size</strong></td><td style=height:24px>36B</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Shoe Size</strong></td><td style=height:24px>8.5 (US)</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Dress Size</strong></td><td style=height:24px>6 (US)</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Profession</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Wrestler, Actress</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Debut</strong></td><td style=height:24px>2017</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Association</strong></td><td style=height:24px>World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Previous Association</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA)</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Sexual Orientation</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Straight</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Relationship Status</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Married (2018)</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Husband</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Tom Budgen (Aleister Black)</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Children</strong></td><td style=height:24px>None</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td style=height:24px>$2 million</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Debut Movie</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Dorothy & the Witches of OZ (2012)</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px><strong>Social Media</strong></td><td style=height:24px>Twitter,&nbsp;Instagram</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><td style=height:24px>Last Update</td><td style=height:24px>2021</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Is_Zelina_Vega_Married_Relationship>Is Zelina Vega Married?
