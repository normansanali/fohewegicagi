At the time Intel was criticised on its pricing: it was offering the same processor minus graphics for the same bulk unit cost, with no discount. Today Intel is adjusting its strategy, and pricing these F and KF processors lower than before.</p><p>Nearly every 9th Generation Core processor for the desktop has a corresponding graphics-free option: the Core i9-9900K has its Core i9-9900KF, the Core i5-9500 has a Core i5-9500F. The difference between these two parts is just a matter of disabled graphics, which means the user can’t take advantage of Intel’s QuickSync or a display, however most of these processors end up in systems with discrete graphics cards anyway. At the time of launch, Intel priced them identically to the parts that did have graphics, but ultimately retail outlets were selling the K and KF processors at a small discount. Intel’s announcement today makes that price difference official.</p><table border=0 width=95%><tbody><tr><td class=contentwhite colspan=10>Intel 9th Gen Core CPUs</td></tr><tr class=tlblue><td>AnandTech</td><td>Cores</td><td>Base<br>Freq</td><td>Turbo<br>Freq</td><td>IGP</td><td>IGP<br>Freq</td><td>DDR4</td><td>TDP</td><td>Old<br>Price<br>(1ku)</td><td>New<br>Price<br>(1ku)</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i9-9900K</td><td>8 / 16</td><td>3.6 GHz</td><td>5.0 GHz</td><td>UHD 630</td><td>1200</td><td>2666</td><td>95 W</td><td>$488</td><td>$488</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i9-9900KF</td><td>8 / 16</td><td>3.6 GHz</td><td>5.0 GHz</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2666</td><td>95 W</td><td>$488</td><td><strong>$463</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i7-9700K</td><td>8 / 8</td><td>3.6 GHz</td><td>4.9 GHz</td><td>UHD 630</td><td>1200</td><td>2666</td><td>95 W</td><td>$374</td><td>$374</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i7-9700KF</td><td>8 / 8</td><td>3.6 GHz</td><td>4.9 GHz</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2666</td><td>95 W</td><td>$374</td><td><strong>$349</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i7-9700F</td><td>8 / 8</td><td>3.6 GHz</td><td>4.9 GHz</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2666</td><td>65 W</td><td>$335</td><td><strong>$298</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i5-9600K</td><td>6 / 6</td><td>3.7 GHz</td><td>4.6 GHz</td><td>UHD 630</td><td>1150</td><td>2666</td><td>95 W</td><td>$262</td><td>$262</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i5-9600KF</td><td>6 / 6</td><td>3.7 GHz</td><td>4.6 GHz</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2666</td><td>95 W</td><td>$262</td><td><strong>$237</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i5-9500</td><td>6 / 6</td><td>3.0 GHz</td><td>4.4 GHz</td><td>UHD 630</td><td>1100</td><td>2666</td><td>65 W</td><td>$192</td><td>$192</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i5-9500F</td><td>6 / 6</td><td>3.0 GHz</td><td>4.4 GHz</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2666</td><td>65 W</td><td>$192</td><td><strong>$167</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i5-9400</td><td>6 / 6</td><td>2.9 GHz</td><td>4.1 GHz</td><td>UHD 630</td><td>1050</td><td>2666</td><td>65 W</td><td>$182</td><td>$182</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i5-9400F</td><td>6 / 6</td><td>2.9 GHz</td><td>4.1 GHz</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2666</td><td>65 W</td><td>$182</td><td><strong>$157</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i3-9350KF</td><td>4 / 4</td><td>4.0 GHz</td><td>4.6 GHz</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2400</td><td>91 W</td><td>$169</td><td><strong>$148</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i3-9100</td><td>4 / 4</td><td>3.6 GHz</td><td>4.2 GHz</td><td>UHD 630</td><td>1000</td><td>2400</td><td>65 W</td><td>$122</td><td>$122</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>i3-9100F</td><td>4 / 4</td><td>3.6 GHz</td><td>4.2 GHz</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2400</td><td>65 W</td><td>$122</td><td><strong>$97</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As mentioned when the F and KF processors were first announced, if users were to put a price tag on Intel’s integrated graphics, what would it be? A cynic might suggest that Intel put that value at $0, and is now increasing it to around $25 depending on the part. Depending on how Intel implements its Gen11 graphics (or Gen12) into future desktop processors is going to be interesting, in case we see more F and KF variants in the future.</p><p>Intel states that this price change is in effect as of today. As this price change effects its OEM bulk pricing (prices given for 1000 units), it may take some time to filter down to the end-user based on stock levels at retailers and OEMs, for those that don’t already have a price difference.</p><h3>Related Reading</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH51hZNqZqKmpJq5bq3Np6auppOawG680aKanmWTqsFuss6rZHKsmGK0prrEq5itoZ%2Bjeqd5wKebZqOWYr2zu8Keqqynoqg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heres-why-fans-are-talking-about-brandi-glanville-again.html><span>←</span><span>Here's Why Fans Are Talking About Brandi Glanville Again</span></a>
