If you want the creamed corn to be spicier, add an extra jalapeno.</li><li><strong>Add flour to thicken</strong> and whisk into the mixture and add cooked corn. Then stir in heavy cream. Let it thicken. Sprinkle with salt and sugar.</li><li><strong>Once it begins to thicken, add pepper jack cheese</strong> a little at a time, stirring after each addition. By adding the cheese a little at a time, it helps to keep the creamed corn extra creamy and allow the cheese to not clump up.</li><li><strong>Taste for seasonings</strong> and drizzle with hot honey, if so desired, when ready to serve.</li><p>If you are looking for more<a href=#> side dish recipes, click HERE</a>.</p><p>If you are looking for <a href=#>Thanksgiving Recipes, click HERE</a>.</p><p class=block-pinterest-cta__title>Pin this now to find it later</p><a href=# title="Share on Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=wp-element-button data-postid=25639 data-pin-do=none data-social-network=Pinterest data-social-action=Pin data-social-target=https://www.modernhoney.com/southwest-creamed-corn/>Pin It</a><ul class=wprm-recipe-instructions readability=6><li id=wprm-recipe-25653-step-0-0 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=-1><p><span>Cook corn according to package intructions.
