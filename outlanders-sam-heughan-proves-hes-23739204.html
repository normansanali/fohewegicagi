You think of all the avenues and paths your family could have taken, and I ended up being Scottish."</p><p>Sam who posed posted a new photo of his rough and ready character from SAS: Red Notice on his Instagram, initially showed off his line of 'The Sassenach' goodies on Instagram in December which he says were 'inspired by his love of Scotland'.</p><h3 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border publication-font brand-bg">More showbiz news</h3><p>At that point the merchandise included scarves, a whisky hip flask, t-shirts and bags.</p><p>Sam revealed to The Rake magazine that he is now planning to extend the line to more wearable items including a kilt and skirt option.</p><p>He explained: "I didn’t know what my family was, and therefore what my tartan was, so I thought, Why not come up with something that everyone can be a part of?</p><p>"Just seeing the weavers making it — such a great tradition in Scotland. It is really important to support those crafts, it is what Britain does really well, great heritage and artisan manufacturers."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCrnZOkv6V6wqhlrqNfmru1sdGtmKKmnZq7tXvCnqOemqKewbp7zq6rpZmembKzv4ysmKZlmJrCqLTAp2Spqp%2BrsrR5x56qZmpjbIB6fo9t</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-was-allen-rosss-wife-what-happened-to-her.html><span>←</span><span>Linda Greene: What Happened to Allen Ross Wife?</span></a>
