There was also a eulogy from Merritt Walker and Walker titled “Reflections of CalBear’s Big Little Life.”</p><p>Earlier this month, the pair shared a joint statement announcing that <a href=#>Callahan died in a “tragic accident.”</a> (Merritt Walker and Walker also <a href=#>share sons Beckham, 10, and Chamberlain</a>, 7.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Blogger-Laura-Merritt-Walkers-3-Year-Old-Son-Honored-With-Celebration-of-Life-After-His-Death-2.jpg><p>“We are completely broken-hearted to share that we lost our precious Callahan in a tragic accident last week,” they wrote via Instagram on February 12. “He was such a blessing and brought so much joy to our whole family. Cal-Bear was absolutely adored by his big brothers and loved them beyond measure. As parents we are completely shattered at the loss of our baby boy.”</p><p>Merritt Walker and Walker said they took “comfort” knowing Callahan is being “held in the arms of Jesus.” They asked for prayers for their family during “this impossible time.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Frisco Texas Fire Department later confirmed to multiple outlets that they responded to a call from the Walker family regarding a drowning but declined to provide further details.</p><p>Before the celebration of life, Merritt Walker uploaded a link to a Spotify playlist that helped the family as they grieved Callahan.</p><p>“We wanted to share a playlist we have put together. It has been on repeat in our home. The truth of these songs is blessing us every day,” she wrote via her Instagram Story on February 18. “These are songs that we have loved in our family for years and each hold a special place to us. We hope they can bless you and meet you wherever you are at God is good. We are learning to praise Him in the valley and the mountaintop all the same.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGalmaWnrm65xKupoqykYsSiuMqeqWagn6O8s7%2BMrKanZaeewal5wp6jnpqilsGqu81mpp9lnJ6zpnnAn6ueql2ZsqLAx2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-liston.html><span>←</span><span>How Surgeon Robert Liston Killed His Patient Plus Two Bystanders</span></a>
