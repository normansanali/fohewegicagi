Filmed in Nashville on a beautiful summer day, the country songstress expresses her true heartache in these scenes which she hopes resonates with fans watching.</p><p>“This video tells the story of a person loosing sleep because the one she’s still in love with is now sleeping with someone else. I did this video in Nashville on a beautiful summer day and each location tells a little piece of the story. I love the bed scenes in the field! It was fun to shoot because I really get to express my heartache in these scenes. The back and forth scenes between the myself and the new girlfriend are very powerful and bring the story home,” she shares in a statement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecretscountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Teigen-Gayse-Sleeping-With-Her-Artwork-V1-3000x3000-1-scaled.jpg><p>After picking up her first guitar at the age of 13, it wasn’t long before songwriting became a passion for Teigen. It was the ability to tell her own story, in her own words, that began Teigen’s love for country music. The desire to create pushed her to get an audio engineering degree before striking out on her own as a full-time musician. She continued to feed that passion with multiple trips to Nashville and co-writing with several industry veterans, including<strong> Chad Kroeger, Gordie Samson, Jeff Trott, Dylan Guthro, Baker Grissom, Phil Barton, Patricia Conroy, David Thompson and Buddy Owen.</strong></p><p>After putting in the hard work, Gayse started seeing real results. She made waves online after releasing her single “<a href=#>I Don’t Wanna Fall In Love Anymore</a>” in 2021, which has roughly 3 Million TikTok views to date. She’s even taken home the honor of Trending Track from Stingray Radio while hitting #43 on the Billboard Country Music charts, and amassing over 350,000 streams! An impressive feat for an independent artist, Gayse’s Top 50 single “I Don’t Need A Boy” won Break Out Artist for Acadia Broadcasting and has accumulated over a million streams, with an impressive 39.2 million views on TikTok.</p><p>Keep scrolling to read our full Q&A with Teigen below and let us know if you’re loving “Sleeping With Her” by either leaving a reaction at the bottom of the post or by sliding into our DMs on Instagram at <a href=#>@celebsecretscountry</a>.</p><p>You can connect with Teigen by giving her a follow on Instagram at <a href=#>@teigsxo</a>.</p><p><strong>Celeb Secrets Country: The music video for your new song “Sleeping With Her” is officially out. How does it feel knowing that you’re able to put a visual story behind the track?</strong></p><p><span><strong>Teigen Gayse</strong>: “I am so happy and so proud with how the video turned out.

Those thoughts can be so haunting, and really cut deep.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>CSC: We know that you filmed the clip down in Nashville over the summer. What are some of your favorite memories from being on set with everyone?</strong></p><p><span><strong>TG</strong>: “I love our filming location – it is the most beautiful place! We did my photoshoot there for the song artwork, so it was nice to go back to a familiar spot where I knew everyone. I love the people I worked with on this, they made it so much fun and effortless. The bed scenes were my favourite because I feel like that is such an important intimate part of the story.”</span></p><p><strong>CSC: “Sleeping With Her” is currently climbing the charts and broke the Top 40 on the radio. For those who haven’t heard the song yet, can you go more into its sound and what inspired it?</strong></p><p><span>TG: It’s got some edge to it for sure.

Can you take us through that moment when you heard you received these honors? How does it feel knowing that you’re being recognized for your hard work?</strong></p><p><span><strong>TG</strong>: “Getting recognized for something you are so passionate about is the most gratifying feeling ever.

If so, what can you tell us about it?</strong></p><p><span><strong>TG</strong>: “Yes I do 😉 I can tell you that I am currently working really hard, and have been back and forth to Nashville writing for the record.”</span></p><p><strong>CSC: What are some goals that you’d like to achieve within the next year?</strong></p><p><span><strong>TG</strong>: “I would love to have a Top 10 at Country Radio, go on a tour with one of my favorite artists.
