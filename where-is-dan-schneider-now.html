While Schneider did deny the misconduct allegations brought against him, Nickelodeon still decided to depart business operations with the producer.</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>Even years later, Nickelodeon fanatics and folks who heavily followed the investigation&nbsp;and happenings continue to wonder what projects and other ventures the former Nickelodeon producer is involved with now.</p><h2 id=h-so-where-is-schneider-now data-injectable=false>So, where is Schneider now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nickelodeon-brand-e1707843643843.jpg><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>Ever since his departure with Nickelodeon, Schneider has kept a relatively low profile, although he does stay active occasionally on Instagram — with his last post paying tribute to the late Matthew Perry. Since the investigation, the TV producer/actor has also remained married to his wife Lisa, whom he married back in 2002.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>Despite the low profile, however, interest in Schneider and the allegations against him have yet to fully die down. As a result, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an upcoming docuseries</a> from Investigation Discovery is set to “explore the toxic environment” that occurred behind the scenes during Schneider’s tenure with Nickelodeon — so it’s fair to say interest will remain at an all-time high.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbHRnmSiq12Zrq950pyfp52ZmbKzec2ormg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vinnie-politan.html><span>←</span><span>Vinnie Politan</span></a>
