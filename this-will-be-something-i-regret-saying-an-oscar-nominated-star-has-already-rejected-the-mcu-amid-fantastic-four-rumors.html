So I feel kind of like ridiculous saying no when it hasn’t been asked, but it’s not something that I am pining to do. I don’t know if I would have the patience required. And I am deeply envious of people who do have that patience.”</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=168 data-injectable=false>For the actor, being part of indie film projects is what gives him joy, and Marvel-like blockbusters require a level of commitment that he did not feel ready to accept:</p><p>“I think sometimes you have to make a decision to let [other projects] go for five, 10, 15 years and that would be really sad.”</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=660 data-injectable=true>It’s worth remembering that Mescal made these claims back in November 2022, which isn’t that long ago. Either this serves as proof that the rumor surrounding his involvement in Fantastic Four is wrong, or Mescal has already gone back on his words. It sure would be ironic for his prediction about regretting saying all this to be spot on.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>Paul Mescal isn’t the only one facing MCU rumors. Daveed Diggs, for example, has also been pointed out as a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">possible member of the Fantastic Four team</a>, along with some fantastic, Oscar-nominated actors. Naturally, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">none of this is enough to please the masses</a>, so one can only imagine what will happen when the official announcements are made.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TBqbXSZq6ipJxir6Z50qiknqyYnruoechmqZ6foprBbr%2FAsqCnn12Wu2670pyYq2WepLqqusCtnJ1lo6mus3nHmqpmmZynsqKw2GapnqKVmMGmsIytn55lnZjCbq3MoptmnpGjwaK%2F06KaZp6fqr9uvtSmpqurXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pooja-hegde.html><span>←</span><span>Pooja Hegde</span></a>
