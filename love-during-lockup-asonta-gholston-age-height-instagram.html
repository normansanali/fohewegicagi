Their unique connection began through video calls, where Raneka admitted to feeling butterflies in her heart, reminiscent of the excitement of school love.

Their passion and love for each other only seemed to intensify with time. Such was the strength of their feelings that Raneka took a significant step in her life by relocating to Atlanta, GA, with her two children, in a bid to be physically closer to Asonta.</span></p><p><span>However, their love story was not without its challenges. Raneka’s family was skeptical about her relationship with Asonta. They questioned whether he was truly deserving of her affection, fearing that he might be talking to other women while being incarcerated. Despite the doubts and concerns of her loved ones, Raneka remained steadfast in her belief that Asonta was the one for her.</span></p><p><span>Even one of Raneka’s clients expressed skepticism about Asonta, questioning whether she had ever met him in person before his incarceration. The client’s concern stemmed from the unknowns and uncertainties associated with a relationship that primarily thrived over phone calls and video chats.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, Raneka’s conviction in Asonta’s love and loyalty remained unshaken. She found comfort in the fact that they had not been physically intimate, believing that what kept their spark alive was the deep emotional connection they shared.
