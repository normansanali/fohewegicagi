<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Wireless, Speakers, Thermals, and Storage</h1></header><section class=post-content><h2>Wireless</h2><p>Acer has outfitted the Swift 3 with a wireless NIC we’ve never tested before, at least not with this branding. The Qualcomm QCA6174A is a 2x2:2 802.11ac network adapter with MU-MIMO support and Bluetooth 4.2 It’s also the basis of the Killer 1535, which we’ve seen in plenty of devices.</p><p><img alt="WiFi Performance - TCP" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph12709/97863.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The performance in terms of bandwidth is fine for the Qualcomm NIC, but much like the Killer 1535, it suffered from several reliability issues during our testing. Several times the NIC would drop off completely, and the machine would have to be restarted to get it to see any access point again. This happened during two battery life tests, and a few other times as well, and is awfully similar to issues we saw with the Killer version of this adapter. Unfortunately we’re at a point in the PC space where there’s not a lot of choice for a quality NIC right now. We did reach out to Acer and they said they’ve not seen this issue, but this is an issue that’s plagued devices with the similar Killer 1535.</p><h2>Speakers</h2><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/12709/IMG_1702_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Acer uses the Acer TureHarmony technology for their speakers in the Swift 3, and the laptop has stereo speakers, but compared to many other laptops, they have a sound that is richer than many other laptops we’ve tested, and there’s plenty of volume as well, with a maximum SPL of 84.5 dB(A) on our test track.</p><h2>Thermals</h2><p>With a 15-Watt TDP processor in a large 15-inch laptop, there’s going to be benefits for cooling, and that definitely plays out. The Swift 3 stays cool under all scenarios, and never gets loud.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/12709/Thermals_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Running the laptop under the load of Tomb Raider shows that even when gaming the system never gets excessively hot. The CPU doesn’t even get to 80°C after an extended session.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/12709/flir_20180501T214542_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Even better, the sound level of the fan never gets excessive, with a measured SPL of just 42.3 dB(A) measured 1-inch over the trackpad. That’s very quiet when gaming.</p><h2>Storage</h2><p>The Swift 3 comes with just two drive options. The 2500U model features a 256 GB SSD, and the higher tier 2700U model comes with 512 GB of SSD. In the review unit, that’s the Micron 1100 SSD, which features 3D TLC with a SATA interface.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/12709/Crystal_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The SATA slows down the maximum performance compared to an NVMe drive, but regardless, the larger included drive in the review unit, without the normal massive price increase we see on most laptops, is very welcome.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH5zg49yZq2glWKupLHRZqqwoZapenR50p9qam1kZnqzsdWinLBloq7HprqMppyerKNiuaK806inaG8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrities.html><span>←</span><span>Viola Davis News</span></a>
