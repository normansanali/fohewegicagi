The newest "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Go With the Flow</a>" Icon Series emote features a quick little dance, and the choreography actually originates from a viral dance on <a href=#>TikTok</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">The "Go With the Flow" emote was inspired by this viral TikTok song.</h2><p>Many of the popular emotes in Fortnite are inspired by (or taken directly from) various viral dances on TikTok, and the "Go With the Flow" emote is no different. The dance was choreographed by<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Madison Patten</a>, a former teacher who now posts original dances on TikTok regularly, set to a song by artist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenna Raine</a>.</p><p>Jenna's song, "It Is What It Is," has more than 40,000 posts using it on the popular app, and many of these videos have tens of thousands of views.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: X/@ForkniteStatuss</a></figure><p>Jenna was formerly a part of the girl group L2M (short for Listening 2 Music), formed as a spin-off from LEGO Friends: Girlz 4 Life. After the group disbanded in 2018, she started her solo career and has since been posting her pop music on TikTok. Currently, she has 1.7 million followers on the app and has more than 2.5 monthly listeners on Spotify.</p><p>Madison, who currently boasts more than 500,000 followers on the app, shared some details about the emote after it went live.</p><p>"This has been in the works for a while, all I had to do was sign off on it ‚Äî I didn't do anything," Madison said in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a>. "I don't play Fortnite, but I might now just so that I can buy my own choreography. This is the coolest thing that's ever come out of TikTok for me. It pretty much makes all of the time I've spent on this app worth it... For something like this to happen is really cool."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@nickpommefritz href=#>@nickpommefritz</a><p>Are you getting the new emote? üòè <a title=fortnite href=#>#fortnite</a> <a title=jennaraine href=#>#jennaraine</a> <a title=emote href=#>#emote</a> <a title=itiswhatitis href=#>#itiswhatitis</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=gowiththeflow href=#>#gowiththeflow</a> <a title=new href=#>#new</a> <a title=usecodenpf href=#>#usecodeNPF</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Go With The Flow - NickPommeFritz" href=#>‚ô¨ Go With The Flow - NickPommeFritz</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Some 'Fortnite' players were hoping the "Go With the Flow" emote would be the dance from 'Wednesday.'</h2><p>Though the new emote has already gained a lot of traction and been celebrated by Jenna and Madison's followers, there are some who aren't entirely thrilled at the launch of this new emote.
