Brandi wrote, "Hey guys, yes, I was admitted to the hospital yesterday and I have amazing first responders taking care of me! We are not exactly sure what we are dealing with we believe it may be an infected spider bite. More tests to run."</p><p>People.com reported tweeted that she was doing well: she said, "Swelling is starting to go down." She added, "Feeling so much better today!!!

According to Page Six, she went on "The Morning Show" in Australia and fans wondered if she had plastic surgery.</p><p>According to Women's Health, Brandi got second-degree burns on her face back in December 2020, and she says that it was a four-month-long healing process. Brandi tweeted that she had an accident with a psoriasis light and that she wasn't going to show anyone pictures, as it sounds like it was a really hard time for the reality star. She said that the Daily Mail was "attacking my looks" so she felt that she should explain what was going on. Brandi also said that she was "still healing."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The ‘RHONY’ Moment Fans Think Went Too Far</a></span></p><h2 id=brandi-on-39-rhobh-39>Brandi On 'RHOBH'</h2><p>Fans remember Brandi Glanville as a "friend" on season 2 of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. She was part of the a full-time cast for seasons 3, 4, and 5, and then she decided to leave.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brandi <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">talked about leaving RHOBH in an interview</a> with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard Stern</a> in 2015. According to Women's Health, she said, “I didn’t want to do the show again. I took so much heat. I was doing things to my own detriment that I couldn’t explain like throwing wine in someone’s face. I’m not sure why. And then I slapped Vanderpump, I’m really not sure why. But at the end of the day, I got so much hate on social media.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brandi also said, “I felt like I played ball, I gave my all to the show, and then when it aired I thought, ‘Oh my God, they did me no favors in the editing room.’ And I got really upset and a little depressed." Brandi is famous for bringing drama into situations, as she would say something that was sure to upset a co-star, but she felt that she had to say it anyway. In season 3, Brandi was upset that Lisa Vanderpump wanted her to talk to Scheana, a SUR employee. Brandi had a good reason as Scheana and Eddie Cibrian, Brandi's ex-husband, had an affair. Lisa didn't see why this was a problem, as Brandi had talked to Scheana previously, but Brandi didn't want to see her at the party. By season 5, Lisa and Brandi definitely didn't get along, and it made sense that Brandi felt it was time to go.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Know About ‘Vanderpump Dogs’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brandi shared with Entertainment Tonight that she assumed she would come back to The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills because with the Denise Richards rumor/scandal, she feels that she brought so much drama. Brandi said, "I was disappointed, honestly, because I felt like I really gave them their season. They used the few times that I shot, like in the trailer and every commercial. I didn't make very much money. I really thought maybe they're going to ask me to come back, because I did so much for that season, and it's just been crickets."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is The Truth About Lisa Rinna’s Daughters’ Disorders</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmnZqmo2Kus7GMrZilo5mjtG6twaisrWWSp66vsMhmnqWZnqu2rbjEZpigmZmjfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sixtyforce.html><span>←</span><span>Download sixtyforce for Mac - Free</span></a>
