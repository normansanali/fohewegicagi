But I couldn’t do it because I had to do Coachella. The week that they wanted to shoot was the week that I had to play Coachella. So I missed out on the Obama movie for Coachella. That’s one hell of a story to tell. You’re the first person I’ve ever told that to in a public space.</p><p>“I was supposed to be his [Obama’s] best friend. I was the guy who was supposed to show him the projects, and show him how black people was living in America at the time.”</p><p>Turning away from acting, Joey also discussed his recently released single, “Devastated.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“During the making of this song, I wanted to give people something different from the rest of my catalog, and something more uptempo. My main objective was to give people a feel-good, uplifting song, ’cause a lot of music in my catalog is really introspective or meditative, critical-thinking type of vibes, or really aggressive type of vibes. So I wanted to switch it up and give my fans something new, like something they can listen to and feel good about. Something that you could play for the whole world&nbsp;–&nbsp;you know, kids, grandmoms, everyone. Something that everyone could relate to.”</p><p>Throughout his career, Joey has consistently labelled himself as an independent rapper. Something he doesn’t consider himself, though, is an underground rapper.</p><p><strong>“</strong>No, I don’t. It’s funny, because I don’t consider myself a mainstream rapper, either. They need to make a new term for me. I’m like a major-indie. Yeah, that’s what I am. I’m not underground, I’m not major label, I’m just major-indie.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>The second season of Mr. Robot premieres tonight (July 13) on USA Network.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZjboNxhY6toK2klWO3sLHYZpmanJFisaq%2Fwq6qrJ2jYr%2BwuMRmoKdlnad6s7vBqKtmpZmowKq6xmamp2WlpbCwucinnmankpa6onnBoqapoZM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gabriel-guevara-girlfriend.html><span>←</span><span>Is He Dating Nicole Wallace?</span></a>
